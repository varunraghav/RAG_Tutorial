If you need to use your syringes during the flight, ask a flight attendant to help you dispose of them safely\n\nFragile, bulky or unusual\n\nIf an item is too fragile or bulky to check, or you feel it needs to be handled with special care, you can\u00a0buy a ticket for it.\n\nBasic Economy\n\nFor most trips you can only bring one personal item when you\u2019re flying in Basic Economy. You can\u2019t bring a carry-on bag unless you\u2019re flying to South America, across the Atlantic or across the Pacific. All other bags have to be checked.

This happens most often on United Express\u00ae flights.\n\nIf you\u2019re flying CommutAir, you\u2019re only allowed one personal item on the plane.\n\nAll other United Express carriers do allow carry-on bags but have limited space.\n\nTo find out if you\u2019re flying on United Express, view your trip in\u00a0My Trips.

But there are a few steps you can take to help reduce this risk:\n\nBefore going to the airport, remove all old bag tags.\n\nIf you're checking a bag, make sure you get to the airport early.\n\nKeep your bag tag receipt. You should also take a picture of your bag and bag tag receipt together for your records.\n\nPlace your phone number or email on a luggage tag or inside the front pocket of your bag so if your bag tag is lost, we can contact you to confirm where to send it.\n\nUse our\u00a0bag tracker\u00a0or a device like an AirTag to keep an eye on your bag.\n\nPlace medication, valuables and other essentials, like keys and your wallet, in the bag you plan to bring on the plane with you.\n\nPack all liquids in a resealable bag. Liquids more than 3.4 oz (100 ml) should be packed in your checked bag.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional info\n\nPrepay for your bags\n\nSave time at the airport by prepaying for your bags. If you\u2019re traveling on a United or United Express flight within the U.S., you can use your miles to pay the baggage fees before check-in.\n\n\n\nFlight and seat changes\n\nIf your flight is canceled, you can request a refund for any checked bag fees.

If you decide to make a change to your trip and use a different airline, the policies of the new airline will apply. The flight number assigned to the first segment of your trip will come from the first airline you used for your trip. If this airline is not United or United Express, different fees may apply.\n\nBag fees are based on the date of ticketing and on the ticketed cabin. They're also based on the traveler's status or membership on the date of travel. Checked bag fees apply at any point where you check a bag.\n\nFor a trip that includes one or more connections, checked bags go to the final stop on the ticket. The fee for checking a bag from your starting point to your last stop will apply. If your connection is to a different airline, you must recheck bags with the new airline. Checked bags can go to your last stop if your new flight is Star Alliance member airline operated.\n\nIf you chose to have a layover, your checked bags will go to your layover point, where you can collect them. When you resume travel, you may check your bags again. Fees may apply.\n\nCertain airports may reject your luggage based on size, weight or number of bags.\n\nMilitary checked bag policy\n\nActive U.S. military personnel and their dependents.\n\nThe benefits below apply only on United- and United Express-operated flights.\n\nType of trip\n\nClass of service\n\nNumber of bags\nwithout service charges\n\nMedium size\n\nMaximum\nweight per bag\n\nPersonal travel\n\nAll classes of service\n\n3 bags\n\n62 in.

When a dependent travels on their own without proof of military orders, the normal allowance and fees apply.\n\n\n\nBasic Economy bag allowance\n\nBasic Economy tickets only include one personal item. They do not include carry-on bags. If you decide to travel with a carry-on bag, you must check it in the airport lobby for a fee starting at $35. If you bring a carry-on bag to the gate that won't fit under the seat, you need to pay a $65 fee to check it.\n\nCommon items\n\nSome items have a few extra rules for how they can be packed.\n\n\n\nElectronic devices\n\nOnboard use\n\nIf you plan to use electronic devices on your flight, you\u2019ll need to follow these safety rules:\n\n\n\nApproved electronic devices must be in airplane mode during flight.\n\n\n\nYou can use your approved devices except at takeoff and landing.\n\n\n\nLaptops and plane power ports can only be used above 10,000 feet.\n\n\n\nYou can only use your phone service when the main cabin door is open or when instructed by a flight attendant.\n\nDevices you can use during your flight\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHandheld gaming consoles\n\nLaptops (above 10,000 feet)\n\nDVD players\n\nMusic players\n\nCalculators\n\nShavers (in bathrooms only)\n\nCameras\n\nSeat charging ports (above 10,000 ft)\n\n\n\nDevices you can't use during your flight\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAir purifying respirators\n\nPersonal humidifiers\n\nE-cigarettes and vapes\n\nTVs\n\nBlow dryers, bottle warmers and things that heat up\n\nRemote-control toys\n\nRadio receivers and transmitters\n\nDangerous items\n\nFederal law doesn't allow these items on a plane:\n\nCamping equipment that contains fuel\n\nDefense sprays like mace, pepper sprays and tear gas\n\nExplosives like fireworks, gunpowder, flares, flare guns and novelty items\n\nReady-to-eat meals (MREs) with a flameless heater\n\nShock absorbers\n\nTasers\n\n\n\ndevices\n\nYou can use small lightweight electronic devices in airplane mode, but flight attendants may ask you to turn them off at different points of your flight.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7133, "end_char_idx": 11602, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d18e303e-621a-4831-a0ca-16ffc682c2ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "d18e303e-621a-4831-a0ca-16ffc682c2ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Military benefits and discounts.docx", "file_path": "/Users/varunraghav/Documents/LlamaIndexProject/United/Military benefits and discounts.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 22238, "creation_date": "2024-12-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8876d43d-7b02-435a-a162-46cf55e99a18", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Military benefits and discounts.docx", "file_path": "/Users/varunraghav/Documents/LlamaIndexProject/United/Military benefits and discounts.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 22238, "creation_date": "2024-12-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-23"}, "hash": "fd5e346dc0100a34984b6a747e17fe9543acd600e946b38bc077d4b60b4d8500", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Military benefits and discounts\n\nUnited is committed to the people who serve our country.

These steps depend on where your dog has been in the past 6 months.\n\nBackground\n\nCDC strives to protect America\u2019s families, communities, and pets by preventing the reintroduction of dog rabies into the United States. Preventing infected dogs from entering the United States is a public health priority. CDC recommends all dogs be vaccinated against dog rabies.\n\nRecent Changes\n\nCDC values the feedback received from various countries, industry partners, and the public. CDC simplified the process for meeting requirements for dogs arriving from dog rabies-free or low-risk countries. This means that for dogs that have been only in dog rabies-free or low-risk countries for the last 6 months, the one form you will need is the\u00a0CDC Dog Import Form, which should take a few minutes to complete.\n\nRequirements are based on your dog's situation\n\nHigh-Risk Countries for Dog Rabies\n\nAt a glance\n\nIf a country or political unit is\u00a0not\u00a0listed below, it is\u00a0not\u00a0considered high risk for importing dog rabies into the United States. Therefore, if the country is\u00a0not\u00a0listed, CDC strongly recommends vaccination against rabies, but the additional requirements for dogs from high-risk countries to enter the United States do not apply.\n\nThese countries and political units are considered high risk for importing dog rabies into the United States.\n\nAfghanistan\n\nAlgeria\n\nAngola\n\nArmenia\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nBangladesh\n\nBelarus\n\nBelize\n\nBenin\n\nBolivia\n\nBotswana\n\nBrazil\n\nBurkina Faso\n\nBurundi\n\nCambodia\n\nCameroon\n\nCentral African Republic\n\nCeuta\n\nChad\n\nChina (excluding Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan)\n\nColombia\n\nComoros\n\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)\n\nCuba\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\n\nDjibouti\n\nDominican Republic\n\nEcuador\n\nEgypt\n\nEl Salvador\n\nEquatorial Guinea\n\nEritrea\n\nEswatini (Swaziland)\n\nEthiopia\n\nGabon\n\nGambia\n\nGeorgia\n\nGhana\n\nGuatemala\n\nGuinea\n\nGuinea-Bissau\n\nGuyana\n\nHaiti\n\nHonduras\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nIran\n\nIraq\n\nIsrael (including the West Bank and Gaza)\n\nJordan\n\nKazakhstan\n\nKenya\n\nKuwait\n\nKyrgyzstan\n\nLaos\n\nLebanon\n\nLesotho\n\nLiberia\n\nLibya\n\nMadagascar\n\nMalawi\n\nMalaysia\n\nMali\n\nMauritania\n\nMelilla\n\nMoldova\n\nMongolia\n\nMorocco (including Western Sahara)\n\nMozambique\n\nMyanmar (Burma)\n\nNamibia\n\nNepal\n\nNiger\n\nNigeria\n\nNorth Korea\n\nOman\n\nPakistan\n\nPeru\n\nPhilippines\n\nQatar\n\nRepublic of the Congo\n\nRussia\n\nRwanda\n\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nSenegal\n\nSierra Leone\n\nSomalia\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nSri Lanka\n\nSudan\n\nSuriname\n\nSyria\n\nTajikistan\n\nTanzania (Including Zanzibar)\n\nThailand\n\nTimor-Leste\n\nTogo\n\nTunisia\n\nTurkey\n\nTurkmenistan\n\nUganda\n\nUkraine\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nUzbekistan\n\nVenezuela\n\nVietnam\n\nYemen\n\nZambia\n\nZimbabwe\n\n\n\nMore info on how to bring dogs from high-risk countries:  https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/foreign-vaccinated-high-risk-countries.html", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3220, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f932c22f-a846-4da7-84f0-6ffa351659fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "f932c22f-a846-4da7-84f0-6ffa351659fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Pets.docx", "file_path": "/Users/varunraghav/Documents/LlamaIndexProject/United/Pets.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 142427, "creation_date": "2024-12-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf514033-32bf-4940-8b92-6be6dc359c09", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Pets.docx", "file_path": "/Users/varunraghav/Documents/LlamaIndexProject/United/Pets.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 142427, "creation_date": "2024-12-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-23"}, "hash": "1daf0f7f6be7863923eee4d1a78a6a50b1fd0453496ca374032ce5b6aee1f333", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a7607f4-3170-4fe6-ab91-ef9720325243", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Pets.docx", "file_path": "/Users/varunraghav/Documents/LlamaIndexProject/United/Pets.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 142427, "creation_date": "2024-12-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-23"}, "hash": "2b26bf76c6058456068d53ab419ad83eb44af5600503cd4951b4d89280db2f46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6c1c6d36-79bf-428f-98d7-a78e74af766c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d1c3f67aa324036d79026614e6424699f9b14152b94b1b72fc740d255308a242", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "More info on how to bring dogs from high-risk countries:  https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/foreign-vaccinated-high-risk-countries.html\n\n\n\nTraveling with pets\n\nBringing your cat or dog with you on your trip is fun, but there are some rules you\u2019ll have to follow. If you\u2019re looking for information on\u00a0traveling with service animals, we can also help with that.\n\nGetting ready\n\nWe no longer let you check your pets through the PetSafe program. Pets can only fly in cargo when traveling with certain\u00a0active-duty military or State Department\u00a0employees. If you plan to fly with your pet, they must be a cat or dog and stay in the cabin with you (if there\u2019s space available).\n\nSome destinations don\u2019t accept pets. Be sure to double-check before your flight.\n\nOn most flights, you can bring up to 2 pets per person. You must buy 2 seats if you\u2019re bringing 2 pets. The second seat needs to be next to your assigned seat, so you can care for both pets.\n\nSome of our planes have limited space under the middle seat. We only allow one pet per person on these aircraft:\n\nA319\n\nA320\n\nA321neo\n\n737-800 and 737-8 (MAX 8)\n\n737-900 and 737-9 (MAX 9)\n\nWhere can I fly with my pet?\n\nAs long as your destination allows pets, you can take them with you on any flight operated by United or United Express. If you\u2019re flying internationally, you\u2019ll need to call 1-800-864-8331 to add a pet to your reservation. If you\u2019re traveling on multiple airlines, including our partners, you\u2019ll also need to check with each one to see what their pet policy is.\n\nUnited does not allow pets to fly to, from or even through the below list of states and countries.\n\nAustralia\n\nBarbados\n\nBrazil\n\nCuba\n\nFrench Polynesia (Tahiti)\n\nGuam *\n\nGuyana\n\nHawaii\n\nHong Kong\n\nIceland\n\nIreland\n\nJamaica\n\nMarshall Islands\n\nMicronesia, Federated States of\n\nMorocco\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNorthern Mariana Islands (Saipan)\n\nPalau\n\nPhilippines\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSweden\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\n\nUnited Arab Emirates (Dubai)\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n* You can bring a pet on flights from Guam to Tokyo-Narita or to the U.S. mainland. You cannot bring your pet on the flight back to Guam. Pet travel from Guam to the U.S. mainland is considered international.\n\nMake sure your pet fits\n\nWhile there are no weight or breed limitations for pets, they must travel in either a hard-sided or soft-sided carrier. This carrier must fit under the seat in front of you or you cannot fly with your pet. The only animals allowed on planes without a pet carrier are\u00a0service animals.\n\nHard-sided carrier\n\n\n\nSoft-sided carrier\n\n\n\nPrepping to fly\n\n\n\nGather paperwork\n\nSome countries don\u2019t allow pets to travel\u00a0at all. Others have strict\u00a0rules for rabies vaccines. Make sure you have all your paperwork and proof of vaccination in order before you leave.\n\n\n\nBooking pet tickets\n\nAll you have to do is select \u201cTravel with a pet\u201d as a traveler during booking on united.com. Or, you can go to\u00a0My Trips\u00a0to add a pet to an existing trip. You cannot add a pet to your trip on the United app.\n\n\n\nFor tickets purchased before 4/26/24, there is a $125 fee each way for traveling with your pet. There is also a $125 fee for each layover of more than four hours for flights within the U.S. and more than 24 hours internationally. You cannot use travel credits to pay this fee.\n\nFor tickets purchased on or after 4/26/24, the fee is $150 each way for traveling with your pet.\n\n\n\nTraveler pro tips\n\nWe have a few recommendations to help you pack a pet-friendly travel kit:\n\nRemember to bring all the essentials to care for your pet while you\u2019re still at the airport, including a collapsible water bowl, leash, treats and plastic bags.\n\nTo keep them calm on the flight, it always helps to have a favorite toy, blanket or pillow that smells familiar.\n\n\n\nAt the airport\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know once you get to the airport.\n\n\n\nChecking in\n\nCheck in for your flight at the ticket counter. You\u2019ll need both your own and your pet\u2019s confirmation numbers, which you can find in your email or in\u00a0My Trips.

The rabies vaccinations must be completed at least 28 days before travel for both dogs and cats. This applies for all international travel, to and from the United States. Any additional rules for traveling to the U.S. depend on whether or not you\u2019re traveling from a country the CDC considers to be high risk for rabies. We closely follow\u00a0CDC guidelines\u00a0on these specific country requirements and recommend checking them to make sure you meet them at least two months before your trip.\n\nIf you\u2019re traveling within the U.S. with your pet, we encourage you to get a certificate of health from your vet. Some destinations may request this certificate on arrival. It should include:\n\nYour name, phone and address\n\nInfo about your pet, including breed, sex, age, color and markings\n\nList of recent vaccines, including names, dates issued and expiration\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere can I sit with my pet on the plane?\n\nWhere you can sit with your pet depends on the type of plane you\u2019re on.

We\u2019re with you every step of the way to make sure your trip goes as smoothly as possible. Or, if you have questions about children flying alone,\u00a0we have the answers.\n\nPlanning your trip\n\nHere's what to keep in mind when booking your tickets and deciding what to bring with you.\n\nTicketing options for children\n\n\n\nInfants on lap\n\nChildren under two can\u00a0sit on a parent\u2019s lap\u00a0during flights to any destination.\n\n\n\nInfant seats\n\nAlternatively, infants can have their own seat if you bring an\u00a0approved car seat.\n\n\n\nAll other kids\n\nChildren two and older will need a ticket and their own seat on the plane.\n\nMake sure your child's seat is wide enough for their car seat.\u00a0First, find your aircraft type under flight details in\u00a0My Trips. Then, select your aircraft's seat map on our\u00a0fleet page. Find the seat width in your cabin and measure your car seat to check that it fits.\n\nFamilies with young children\n\nWe allow families with children less than two years old to board with our pre-boarding group. A gate agent will announce when it\u2019s time for you to get on the plane.\n\nIf you\u2019re traveling with children under 12, they won\u2019t have to sit by themselves. The first adult listed on the reservation can sit next to up to two children in their party for free. After you book your flight, you can select these seats in My trips. You can also choose your seats by going to the seat map in the United app and selecting \u201cSeat preferences\u201d. We will show you all available Basic Economy and Economy seats. The rest of your party may be given seats in a different part of the plane. To make sure your entire group stays together, consider paying to select seats for everyone.\n\nSometimes, seat assignments change because of unscheduled aircraft changes. If this happens on your flight, and your children are separated from an adult, you can switch to another flight with open seats in the same cabin for free.\n\nInfant bag allowance\n\nIf you\u2019re traveling with an infant who has a ticket, you can check bags in their name. These bags must follow the\u00a0standard bag rules. Infant bags that are\u00a0oversized or overweight\u00a0will be checked in under the traveling adult's name. If this happens, you may have to pay\u00a0additional bag fees\u00a0at the airport. You cannot check bags in an infant\u2019s name if they do not have a ticket.\n\n\n\nTraveler pro tips\n\nWe have a few tips to make sure you\u2019re ready for common situations that come up while traveling with kids:\n\nIf your little one is using a tablet to watch movies or play games, make sure the device is fully charged in case you aren\u2019t sitting next to an outlet and bring headphones.\n\nEasily relieve ear pressure during takeoff and landing by keeping snacks on hand.\n\nIn case your flight is delayed make sure you have extra diapers, formula, bottles and other essentials in the bag you bring onboard.\n\nIf your little one is anxious or excited for their trip, our\u00a0flying social story\u00a0can help them prepare.\n\nAt the airport\n\nHow you get through the airport depends on the age of your kids. Here\u2019s what to keep in mind.\n\n\n\nThe security line\n\nChildren under 18 don\u2019t need an ID to fly domestically but do need a passport for international flights. You can also bring breast milk or formula through security, even if your child isn\u2019t with you. But, be sure you meet\u00a0TSA guidelines.\n\n\n\nGetting to the gate\n\nStandard strollers, folding wagons, and car seats can be used to get to your gate and then checked for free. They\u2019ll be returned to you on arrival.

We request all travelers\u00a0attach instructions to checked wheelchairs\u00a0so ground personnel handles your equipment properly. These instructions should include information about the type of battery your wheelchair uses and will affect how your chair is transported.\n\nBattery type\n\nInstructions\n\nWet-cell batteries\n\nIf your wheelchair cannot fit upright through the cargo door, we must remove the battery and transport it in a special battery box to meet federal dangerous goods handling requirements. If the battery is damaged or leaking, it cannot be transported.\n\nDry- or gel-cell batteries\n\nIf your wheelchair cannot fit upright through the cargo door, it will be loaded on its side with the battery attached, and then placed upright once inside the cargo hold. We\u2019ll need confirmation the wheelchair cannot be accidentally turned on before loading or the battery cables will need to be disconnected.\n\nLithium-ion batteries\n\nIf the battery is in a protective casing, then the chair will be loaded upright or on its side, and then placed upright once inside the cargo hold with the battery attached. If this isn\u2019t the case, the battery must be removed and stored in your carry-on. You must also let a flight attendant know you\u2019ve brought the battery on board.\n\nIf you aren't sure what type of battery your wheelchair uses, we recommend checking the battery itself as they are required by law to be labeled clearly. Most wheelchairs utilize a gel-cell battery.\n\nWhat if I have to take a more expensive flight so my wheelchair can fit?\n\nIf you use the wheelchair filter when you book a flight and have to take a more expensive one for your wheelchair to fit, you can be refunded the price difference. Your flights must meet the following criteria to qualify for a refund:\n\nBoth flights mut be operated by United or United Express.\n\nBoth flights must have the same origin and destination.\n\nBoth flights must be non-stop or both flights must have connections.\n\nYou can\u00a0request a refund\u00a0after you\u2019ve completed your trip. Include the following in your request:\n\nThe dimensions you entered for your wheelchair while searching for your flight.\n\nA screenshot showing the cost of the flight you weren\u2019t able to take with your wheelchair. Your screenshot must include the dates and the base fare.\n\nA copy of your receipt for the flight you were able to take.\n\nHow you take a screenshot depends on the device you have. All screenshots must be clear and easy to read.\n\n\nWill you tilt my wheelchair while loading it in cargo?\n\nSometimes we have to tilt wheelchairs to load them on our planes, but we try to avoid this if we can. When booking your flight, use the wheelchair filter to only view planes that will fit your wheelchair through the cargo door without tilting.\n\nIf your wheelchair can\u2019t fit on the plane without tilting, contact our Accessibility Desk at 1-800-228-2744 for assistance. Please note, wheelchairs with wet-cell batteries cannot be tilted during transport for safety reasons.\n\nWe may slightly tilt or maneuver your wheelchair during loading or unloading if we\u2019re comfortable we can without damaging it or injuring our employees.
