BUSINESSOverviewWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). We connect consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cRides Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connect consumers (\u201cEater(s)\u201d) with restaurants (\u201cRestaurant(s)\u201d) and food delivery service providers (\u201cDelivery People\u201d) for meal preparation and delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Rides Drivers and Delivery People are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s)\u201d. We also connect consumers with public transportation networks, e-bikes, e-scooters and other personal mobility options. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. We are also developing technologies that will provide autonomous driving vehicle solutions to consumers, networks of vertical take-off and landing vehicles and new solutions to solve everyday problems.Our technology is available in 69 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).Our SegmentsWe have five operating and reportable segments: Rides, Eats, Freight, Other Bets, and Advanced Technologies Group (\u201cATG\u201d) and Other Technology Programs. Rides, Eats, Freight and Other Bets platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets. ATG and Other Technology Programs is focused on the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle and ridesharing technologies, as well as Uber Elevate.RidesRides refers to products that connect consumers with Rides Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Rides also includes activity related to our Uber for Business (\u201cU4B\u201d), Financial Partnerships, and Vehicle Solutions offerings.We believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 65141, "end_char_idx": 67646, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea16d10a-ec50-45c7-9bb4-2181e66d26c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea16d10a-ec50-45c7-9bb4-2181e66d26c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b4e69586-a003-4b19-aa6c-02dd8f49db5e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "35fc1fbd8911997af901e941809562ee21012eb9f45a1622d227f9c0047a2847", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1bfd3eb8-89c0-4b7c-8969-300cae546cf7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3094a4b4fe91210980b38a0754e0f029e71ac015c4858772d21a0ff231f23932", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Rides also includes activity related to our Uber for Business (\u201cU4B\u201d), Financial Partnerships, and Vehicle Solutions offerings.We believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Rides Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates. At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab, and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.EatsOur Eats offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered. We launched our Eats app over four years ago. We believe that Eats not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Eats enables Rides Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Rides times. Eats also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Rides Drivers or who do not have access to Rides-qualified vehicles to deliver meals on our platform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Eats provides Restaurants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Restaurants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses. In October 2019, we announced a majority investment in Cornershop, a leading provider of online grocery delivery in Mexico and Chile.

The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval.FreightWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry today is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles, which are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand 4platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.We serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.In March 2019, we announced the expansion of our Freight offering into Europe. Although Europe\u2019s freight market is one of the largest and most sophisticated in the world, we believe that European shippers and carriers experience many of the same pain points in their current operations as U.S. shippers and carriers.Other BetsThe Other Bets segment consists of multiple investment stage offerings.

The largest investment within the segment is our New Mobility offering that refers to products that provide consumers with access to rides through a variety of modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (\u201cNew Mobility\u201d). New Mobility also includes Transit, UberWorks and our Platform Incubator group, which is responsible for innovating new services and use cases on our platform to drive long-term growth and cross-platform customer engagement.We are investing in new modes of transportation that enable us to address a wider range of consumer use cases and represent a significant opportunity to bring additional trips onto our platform. We believe that dockless e-bikes and e-scooters address many of these use cases and will replace a portion of these vehicle trips over time, particularly in urban environments that suffer from substantial traffic during peak commuting hours.ATG and Other Technology ProgramsThe ATG and Other Technology Programs segment is primarily responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle and ridesharing technologies, as well as Uber Elevate.ATG focuses on developing autonomous vehicle technologies, which we believe have the long-term potential to provide safer and more efficient rides and deliveries to consumers, as well as lower prices. Along the way to a potential future autonomous vehicle world, we believe that there will be a long period of hybrid autonomy, in which autonomous vehicles will be deployed gradually against specific use cases while Drivers continue to serve most consumer demand. As we solve specific autonomous use cases, we will deploy autonomous vehicles against them. Such situations may include trips along a standard, well-mapped route in a predictable environment in good weather. In other situations, such as those that involve substantial traffic, complex routes, or unusual weather conditions, we will continue to rely on Drivers. Accordingly, we believe that we will be uniquely suited for this dynamic phase during the expected long hybrid period of co-existence of Drivers and autonomous vehicles. Drivers are therefore a critical and differentiating advantage for us and will continue to be an advantage in the long term. We plan to continue to partner with original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d), other suppliers, such as Toyota and DENSO, and other technology companies to determine how to most effectively leverage our network during the transition to autonomous vehicle technologies.Platform SynergiesOur PlatformThe foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 71914, "end_char_idx": 74666, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7012ccee-33ee-4625-9bff-6bcbd159d4d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "7012ccee-33ee-4625-9bff-6bcbd159d4d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "925ce0a9-6686-4b9a-a8e8-eec3bf50d6df", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "346dc364802116f045ab49be96fb5b611dd3a9b4d1e474ad49ead095d4c93dbe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "df9aaa06-0f98-4f5a-87ce-04fe8d8c0dc1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b6e6170f7e43f4620b6c0d27ec89396d6340e8292f71ca21186ae38d81fa6a33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Together, these elements power movement from point A to point B.Massive Network\u00a0Our massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Restaurants, shippers, carriers, and dockless e-bikes and e-scooters, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure.

We face significant competition in each of the ridesharing, meal delivery, and freight industries globally from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:\u2022Rides. Our Rides offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, and livery services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Rides offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities.

We are continuing to operate in London, while we have appealed this decision and expect a hearing in Westminster Magistrates Court in mid-2020.\u2022In January 2019, we suspended our Rides products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers.\u2022In addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our Ridesharing products), including a cap on the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New York City also established a standard for time and distance designed to target minimum hourly earnings for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City and surrounding areas. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019, and the regulator will update them periodically. We continue to work through adjustments with respect to rider promotions, driver supply, and other aspects of our business in response to these regulations; however, these regulations had a negative impact on our financial performance in New York City throughout 2019 and may have a similar adverse impact in the future. In August 2019, New York City issued a regulation to limit how much time drivers providing ride-hailing services can spend cruising streets in busy areas of Manhattan without passengers. In December 2019, a New York state judge struck down this regulation, which was to come into effect in February 2020. New York City is appealing this ruling. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020.\u2022In December 2017, the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cCJEU\u201d) ruled in the Elite referral case that the peer-to-peer Ridesharing service UberPOP was inherently linked to a transport service and, accordingly, must be classified as \u201ca service in the field of transport\u201d within the meaning of applicable European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) legislation rather than an information society service.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 83275, "end_char_idx": 85687, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11bfd325-0ddf-4ce4-b482-9be709f78d51": {"__data__": {"id_": "11bfd325-0ddf-4ce4-b482-9be709f78d51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b496b22-15f5-4c33-a2aa-7070fad3ad42", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "f16910e3ec3d05116afb728e42894b93c050806ac60f9984d85935eba1855c7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "87244191-ce48-4ab8-84bd-9df5770a2dc1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e13c80926e2cf6f92638123c22998bfdd61eb13482be5d7b98640c90614cef83", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This ruling requires us to comply with national laws, rules, and regulations, if any, governing transport services in respect of the specific UberPOP product. The majority of our Ridesharing products in the EU currently operate under licensing regimes where one or more of Drivers, vehicles, or we are required to register or hold licenses to provide services. As such, while Member States can decide how to interpret this CJEU ruling in their national laws, rules, and regulations in accordance with applicable EU law, we believe the ruling will have a limited impact on our business and operations.\u2022In 2015, German authorities banned our peer-to-peer ridesharing product, UberPOP, after a court ruled that it violated local applicable laws, including transport laws, by intermediating riders with drivers operating without professional licenses.\u2022In Italy, while we currently have limited ridesharing operations through our licensed ridesharing product, UberBLACK, in Rome and Milan and a taxi product in Turin, we continue to face limitations due to extensive operational requirements faced by licensed drivers.In addition to the foregoing, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform.  For example, in California, State Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020, codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. AB5 provides a mechanism for determining whether workers of a hiring entity are employees or independent contractors, but AB5 does not result in any immediate change in how workers are classified. If the State of California, cities or municipalities, or workers disagree with how a hiring entity classifies workers, AB5 sets forth the test for evaluating their classification. As we explore legal options, we have received and expect to continue to receive claims by or on behalf of Drivers that claim that the Drivers have been misclassified, and should be classified as employees.

The U.S. Congress has passed and may continue to consider legislation relating to the regulation of autonomous vehicle testing or general deployment.  Certain U.S. states and localities have imposed legal restrictions or other requirements on the testing or general deployment of autonomous vehicles, and many other states are considering them. Autonomous vehicle laws, rules, and regulations are expected to continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions in the United States and in foreign countries and may impose restrictions on our ability to develop, test and commercially deploy autonomous vehicles on our network.Data Protection and PrivacyOur technology platform, and the user data it collects and processes to run our business, are an integral part of our business model and, as a result, our compliance with laws dealing with the collection and processing of personal data is core to our strategy to improve platform user experience and build trust. Regulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Two examples of such regulations that have significant implications for our platform are the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), a data privacy security law which went into effect in May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and security requirements for covered businesses.Payments and Financial ServicesMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 88055, "end_char_idx": 90767, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b840354-61a2-4929-b725-ed97a6cb0680": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b840354-61a2-4929-b725-ed97a6cb0680", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "87244191-ce48-4ab8-84bd-9df5770a2dc1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "5ade3b7ffa3829f54d5b996f1149c94931a38b789e4184dda8bccdb2a270ac06", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "88c48313-de24-4fd5-a09b-d7c23f8c1c1f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a154c1fce0aa6479da54f0e85e6fe1f2272b96117808d28c6f85c00ddfe47e28", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized as an electronic money institution in support of certain payment activities in the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d).

We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors.

Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions. Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers could be material to our business. For example, in March 2019, we reached a preliminary settlement in the O\u2019Connor, et al., v. Uber Technologies, Inc. and Yucesoy v. Uber Technologies, Inc., et al., class actions, pursuant to which we agreed to pay $20 million to Drivers who contracted with us in California and Massachusetts but with whom we have not entered into arbitration agreements, and who sought damages against us based on misclassification, among other claims.

We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements. We anticipate the aggregate amount of payments to Drivers under these individual settlement agreements, together with attorneys\u2019 fees, will fall within an approximate range of $149 million to $170 million, of which approximately $149 million has been paid as of December\u00a031, 2019.

The preliminary injunction was denied, but the plaintiff also seeks a permanent injunction.

In December 2019, a New York state judge struck down this regulation, which was to come into effect in February 2020. New York City is appealing this ruling.  Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020.  In addition, other jurisdictions such as Seattle have in the past considered or may consider regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform.

We conduct real-world testing of our autonomous vehicles, which currently includes at least one trained driver in the driver\u2019s seat monitoring operations while the vehicle is in autonomous mode. In March 2018, one such test vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona. Following that incident, we voluntarily suspended public-road testing of our autonomous vehicles for several months in all markets where we were conducting real-world testing, which was a setback for our autonomous vehicle technology efforts. The National Transportation Safety Board investigated the collision, and, in its conclusion, recommended that we implement certain safety risk management measures for autonomous driving system testing.   While we continue to implement and monitor a safety risk management system, we cannot assure you that such a system will prevent additional collisions involving our autonomous vehicles. We currently test vehicles in autonomous mode on public roads in Pennsylvania, and, in February 2020, were issued a permit to test autonomous vehicles on California public roads with a trained driver in the vehicle.

We have not to date, but may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activity may not completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we do not have experience establishing hedging programs, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.Our acquisition of Careem is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.In March 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire Careem for approximately $3.1 billion, consisting of up to approximately $1.7 billion of the Careem Convertible Notes and approximately $1.4 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 232308, "end_char_idx": 234781, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1cf3f5ed-697e-4f82-8117-9a18be8517db": {"__data__": {"id_": "1cf3f5ed-697e-4f82-8117-9a18be8517db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a67bed46-3a95-4b3e-bff2-772df51dac03", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "2f8df4292ba519d9a3a7a765d3c716000bcf417fd675193a23bbbaa1836a8803", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9799a7db-caf8-42b0-885e-60b0de73fbad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed2c998c743df044d737e1a577ed91f3ff9fb932a3a57ac2741c9f6e988c7eff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In January 2020, we completed the acquisition following clearance of the transaction in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which represent substantially all of the major markets where regulatory approval was required, and in February 2020, we received regulatory approval in Pakistan. We continue to seek regulatory approval in Qatar and Morocco, and upon receipt of such approvals, we will proceed to close the acquisition of the Careem businesses in those countries.

Additionally, most dockless e-bike and e-scooter operating regulations are jurisdiction-specific and many jurisdictions have broad and evolving interpretations of what constitutes compliance with their regulations. This operational uncertainty increases our exposure to reputational damage, financial harm, reduced availability of and demand for our products, and our ability to efficiently manage operations.Changes in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Competition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices are too high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. In February 2020, a purported assignee of Sidecar, an early competitor in the ridesharing business, re-filed a lawsuit against us asserting claims under both federal and California law based on allegations that we engaged in anti-33competitive conduct, after a federal judge dismissed Sidecar\u2019s original lawsuit against us, which was based on similar allegations.

Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that may impact our business. We may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security breach that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our general liability insurance and corporate risk program may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent data privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations domestically and internationally, we may become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacy. The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 281167, "end_char_idx": 283770, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f8f5723-8b4f-49ab-8394-7e5c86c1eb4c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f8f5723-8b4f-49ab-8394-7e5c86c1eb4c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "044dcbf3-fa51-4f22-8d0c-0bb35b4779ee", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "d7319bd389042593d5e787d3959089ac237d06da577083c3143c8782bb2e7377", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b5eaa906-9626-43d3-a830-d94a3947c48c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5f75a27ba7e093b37251e6be552a422ecc47c6e206f7ec9e151c4a2b305e0e81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the CCPA, which provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action against businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches.

We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have recently received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions.

However, numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company.

In addition, in early 2017, we settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs.

Even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, the time and resources needed to resolve them could divert our management\u2019s resources and seriously harm our business.As a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d), to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.

Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. In addition, as our business continues to grow in size and complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline required for a public company. We may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge to compile the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. In addition, prior to completing our internal control assessment under Section 404, we may become aware of and disclose material weaknesses that will require timely remediation. Due to our significant growth, especially with respect to high-growth offerings like Eats, Freight, and New Mobility, we face challenges in consistent performance of controls in response to evolving risks of misstatement. In addition, due to our continuous development of new products and technology solutions, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing or executing controls. Our financial reporting infrastructure, including our information technology general computer systems and controls, is also evolving in support of our growing business activities and continued enhancement and automation of our internal control over financial reporting, which results in challenges in the design and consistent execution of such controls.

We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and interim rulings.44ITEM 4.

Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 358642, "end_char_idx": 361009, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be6473b4-0ebb-4bb6-986c-a68fe983c9e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "be6473b4-0ebb-4bb6-986c-a68fe983c9e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "83178db0-4a80-4df7-9c15-56a1e8ea1de4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "c0e9f252d6257caf0264dac300e6458d6ceb4e4656b199b82bc4d02b458e375a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e3bf3c91-8dd7-4647-a49b-0d6235465aaa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "55eca7c290bda9cae4ec16ed7ad6f55b896dcc8b30a8b1a478918c0c735493b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "AB5 went into effect in January 2020.AB5 provides a mechanism for determining whether workers of a hiring entity are employees or independent contractors, but the new law does not result in any immediate change in how workers are classified. If the State of California, cities or municipalities, or workers disagree with how a hiring entity classifies workers, AB5 sets forth the test for evaluating their classification. A similar ABC test was adopted more than 10 years ago in Massachusetts.We continue to evaluate the impact of AB5 on our business. In January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.  In addition, we are considering legal responses, additional potential business changes, a potential legislative amendment and have filed a California state ballot initiative which will be voted on in November 2020. The ballot initiative does not ask for exemption from AB5, although many other industries in California received an exemption from the ABC test through special amendments. Instead, we are working to provide voters with an opportunity to support a framework that advocates for legal certainty regarding the status of independent work, and seeks to protect worker flexibility and the quality of on-demand work, while establishing the following:\u2022a guaranteed minimum earnings standard for Drivers;\u2022occupational/accident insurance for injury protection;\u2022healthcare subsidies; and\u2022protection against discrimination and harassment.As we explore legal options, we have received and expect to continue to receive claims by or on behalf of Drivers that claim that the Drivers have been misclassified.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 361010, "end_char_idx": 363011, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3bf3c91-8dd7-4647-a49b-0d6235465aaa": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3bf3c91-8dd7-4647-a49b-0d6235465aaa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "be6473b4-0ebb-4bb6-986c-a68fe983c9e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "edf1cfc3edd9fd1b8dbbe9961d30b7c5412bcbfa2228ff7109e4233907993550", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c4c0c14c-16fb-4d6e-bb7a-2e69039e1909", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "51956f25eecdf382421f9e2f0e8315f95ee1b63f91e98e56ff551e7dfb4cda8e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Company believes that these claims are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously.For a discussion of risk factors related to AB5, including how AB5 may impact our business, result of operations, financial position and operating condition, see the risk factor titled \u201c-Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, and Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Transport for London (\u201cTfL\u201d)TfL denied our application for a new license on November 25, 2019.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.70We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 429520, "end_char_idx": 432189, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "681c31ed-7547-49be-9f47-294e4303765b": {"__data__": {"id_": "681c31ed-7547-49be-9f47-294e4303765b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba8e4d9a-13e6-44c5-b0cf-00cc0b7b895f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "61cdcd94ba5d6181a194cec5103af952c4808875d8a158f491e5a615b8e8a5f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "926f4d95-8d89-4822-b9ad-2e9bd49b039f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "014dfece4a523bfb0e3cabe3d98a56a060f9beae368be4da10cb58cb42b9f3d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.70We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Restaurants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or Eats meal delivery. Because end-users access our platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Further, judgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). We have concluded that we are an agent as we arrange for Drivers and Restaurants to provide the service to the end user in Rides and Eats transactions. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. Because we have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips, and because we cannot control whether Drivers will generate future earnings that we can offset to collect our service fee, we have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver IncentivesAs Drivers are our customers, Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service received.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 431791, "end_char_idx": 434609, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "926f4d95-8d89-4822-b9ad-2e9bd49b039f": {"__data__": {"id_": "926f4d95-8d89-4822-b9ad-2e9bd49b039f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "681c31ed-7547-49be-9f47-294e4303765b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "fd1aef59bb3aa455facf0535bc1d7048d2335a29e6a908f3f22de6b606c47562", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "605ecfed-18f7-4f97-b267-b8750c5c81c1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c66054aa3c7495691eecf7d7f6571c259d058a33a4ea281d6e3a6e439662ca6c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver IncentivesAs Drivers are our customers, Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service received. Driver incentives that are not for a distinct service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the Drivers at the time or as they are earned by the Drivers, depending on the type of Driver incentive.We evaluate whether the cumulative amount of Driver incentives that are not in exchange for a distinct service provided to Drivers exceeds the cumulative revenue earned since inception of the Drivers relationship. When the cumulative amount of these Driver incentives exceeds the cumulative revenue earned since inception of the Drivers relationship, the excess Driver incentives are recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. As a result, Driver incentives provided to Drivers at the beginning of a relationship are typically classified as cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, while Driver incentives provided to Drivers with a more mature relationship are typically classified as a reduction of revenue.Referral incentives offered by us and earned by Drivers for performing marketing services of referring other Drivers to drive on our platform are recorded as sales and marketing expense, as we receive a distinct service. The amount recorded is the lesser of the amount of the Driver incentive paid or the established fair market value of the distinct service received. Fair market value of the distinct service is estimated using amounts paid to vendors for similar services.End-User Discounts and PromotionsWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users to encourage use of our platform.

Accordingly, we record the cost of these promotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the trip is completed.Embedded DerivativesWe have issued Convertible Notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. These embedded features are composed of conversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our 71stock rather than cash, because the total number of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features will have a fixed value. These conversion options are bifurcated from the underlying instrument and accounted for and valued separately from the host instrument. Embedded derivatives are recognized as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We measure these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.We value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of the Convertible Notes with and without the Qualified Initial Public Offering (\u201cQIPO\u201d) conversion option (\u201cQIPO Conversion Option\u201d). The fair value of the Convertible Notes with and without the QIPO Conversion Option is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow model to discount the expected payoffs at various potential QIPO dates to the valuation date. The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring at various points in time and the discount yield, which was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance date of the Convertible Notes. The discount rate is updated during each period to reflect the yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date.

Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer. Investments in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with the changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for investments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.Privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requires judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level\u00a03 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available including observed transactions such as equity financing transactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees\u2019 securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar to the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.We assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equity securities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee\u2019s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors.

If an investment in debt securities is determined to have an impairment that is other-than-temporary, if we do not intend to sell, and if it is not more likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the debt security, then only credit losses, if any, are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. The determination of the impairment loss may include the use of various valuation methodologies and estimates.Equity Method InvestmentsWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not own a controlling financial interest, using the equity method. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we recognize through our consolidated statement of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the entities\u2019 net income or loss and reflect the amortization of basis differences. In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities\u2019 net income or loss one quarter in arrears.We review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable. Qualitative and quantitative factors considered as indicators of a potential impairment include financial results and operating trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the investee\u2019s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding the investment, among other factors. If an impairment is identified, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determined and an impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment. The fair value determination, particularly for investments in privately held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of the impairment charges.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, non-income tax, or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:Interest Rate RiskOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2016 Term Loan Facility and our 2018 Term Loan Facility. The 2016 Term Loan Facility and 2018 Term Loan Facility are floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.

Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk.

Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

(\u201cUber\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cRides Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects consumers (\u201cEater(s)\u201d) with restaurants (\u201cRestaurant(s)\u201d) and food delivery service providers (\u201cDelivery People\u201d) for meal preparation and delivery services.  Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Rides Drivers and Delivery People are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s)\u201d. Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks, e-bikes, e-scooters and other personal mobility options. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide autonomous driving vehicle solutions to consumers, networks of vertical take-off and landing vehicles and new solutions to solve everyday problems.The Company\u2019s technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).Segment ChangeDuring the third quarter of 2019, following a number of leadership and organizational changes, the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) changed how he assesses performance and allocates resources to a more disaggregated level in order to optimize utilization of the Company\u2019s platform as well as manage research and development of new technologies. Based on this change, in the third quarter of 2019, the Company determined it has five operating and reportable segments: Rides, Eats, Freight, Other Bets, and Advanced Technologies Group (\u201cATG\u201d) and Other Technology Programs.

The price was $45.00 per share. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $8.0 billion from the IPO after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $106 million and offering expenses. Upon closing of the IPO: i) all shares of the Company\u2019s outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 905 million shares of common stock; ii) holders of the 2021 Convertible Notes and the 2022 Convertible Notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into 94 million shares of common stock; and, iii) an outstanding warrant which became exercisable upon the closing of the IPO was exercised to purchase 0.2 million shares of common stock. In addition, the Company recognized a net gain of $327 million in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations upon conversion of the 2021 Convertible Notes and the 2022 Convertible Notes during 2019, which consisted of $444 million gain on extinguishment of debt and settlement of derivatives, partially offset by $117 million loss from the change in fair value of embedded derivatives prior to settlement. The extinguishment of debt resulted in the derecognition of the carrying value of the debt balance and settlement of embedded derivatives.Upon the Company\u2019s IPO, the Company recognized $3.6 billion of stock-based compensation expense for awards with a performance-based vesting condition satisfied at IPO. Shares were then issued related to the vesting of the restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") with such performance-based vesting conditions.

On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to the incremental borrowing rate (\u201cIBR\u201d) applied in lease accounting, fair values of investments and other financial instruments, useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets and intangible assets, stock-based compensation, income taxes and non-income tax reserves, certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities, insurance reserves, and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.Concentration of Credit RiskCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject to credit risk concentration. Cash is deposited with financial institutions around the world that the Company believes are of high credit quality. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. The Company's other receivables primarily consist of funds withheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims. The Company relies on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\"payment service providers\") to collect amounts due from end-users. Payment service providers are financial institutions or credit card companies that the Company believes are of high credit quality. None of the Company's Drivers and Restaurants or Freight Customers accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.Certain Significant Risks and UncertaintiesThe Company has incurred significant net losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of 16.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. The operations of the Company have historically been funded through equity and debt financings. While management currently anticipates that the Company's available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet the Company's operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, additional capital may need to be raised or additional indebtedness incurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 486634, "end_char_idx": 489222, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f263315c-9da6-4d10-9ed2-6dd274eebf2d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f263315c-9da6-4d10-9ed2-6dd274eebf2d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "799e9ee6-16e5-43d5-ae43-42b8490fa6a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "f5f37286a9d34a0e3da9cb1af23c6afe5798c2db8d91ec44752968ff1c92664b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5316fda0-2c07-40d9-98e1-fb3ba72a4bb3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5ded8a1ada5fed3be1c70c786290eb9c38186c999dad262a8582df7cde95b24", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Company may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, or its ability to incur additional indebtedness may be restricted by the terms of its existing debt instruments.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 consisted of cash held in checking and savings accounts as well as investments in money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate bonds.

The timing of settlement of amounts due from these parties varies by region and by product. The portion of the fare receivable to be remitted to Drivers and Restaurants is included in accrued and other current liabilities. Refer to Note 10 - Supplemental Financial Statement Information for amounts payable to Drivers and Restaurants.Although the Company pre-authorizes forms of payment to mitigate its exposure, the Company bears the cost of any accounts receivable losses. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for fare and invoiced amounts that may never settle or be collected, as well as for credit card chargebacks including fraudulent credit card transactions. The Company considers the allowance for doubtful accounts for fare amounts to be direct and incremental costs to revenue earned and, therefore, the costs are included as cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.

The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The Company evaluates its reporting units when changes in its operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassigns goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if the Company concludes otherwise, the Company proceeds to the quantitative assessment.The quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

This election is reassessed each reporting period to determine whether non-marketable equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for this election. Equity securities that the Company elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company had no investments in equity securities whose fair value was readily determinable as of December 31, 2018 and 2019.

Impairment indicators might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell, or a completed auction process for the same or similar securities for an amount less than the carrying amount of the investments in those securities.

Investments in marketable debt securities include commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds. Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities with redemption, interest, or other debt-like 90features are classified as available-for-sale debt securities. Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The Company records certain of its debt securities at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded in earnings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments. The Company evaluates its available-for-sale debt securities for impairment at each reporting period. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as the Company\u2019s ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Factors considered include: recent financial results and operating trends; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect the value of the Company\u2019s investments; severity and length of the decline in value; and the Company\u2019s strategy and intentions for holding the investment.Impairment of the Company\u2019s debt securities is recognized in earnings when a decline in value has occurred that is deemed to be other than temporary, and the current fair value becomes the new cost basis for the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the unrealized loss is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors, which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company considers its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classifies these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets. Certain investments in non-marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale debt securities are included in investments on the consolidated balance sheets.Equity Method InvestmentsInvestments in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide the Company with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controlling financial interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

Evidence of a loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment.

The Company measures the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying amount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows it expects the asset group to generate.

The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company determines whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether the Company is still the primary beneficiary.

The Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers and Restaurants\u2019 use of the Company\u2019s platform and related service which includes on-demand lead generation, and related activities, including facilitating payments from end-users, that enable Drivers and Restaurants to seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Rides services and Eats services (the \u201cUber Service\u201d) and from customers' use of Freight, Other Bets, and ATG and Other Technology Programs. The Company periodically reassesses its revenue recognition policies as new offering become materials, and business models and other factors evolve.       Rides and Eats Master Services AgreementsThe Company enters into Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) with Drivers and Restaurants to use the platform. The MSA defines the service fee the Company charges Drivers and Restaurants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, the Drivers and Restaurants agree to perform the Rides or Eats services as requested by an end-user. The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between the Company and the Drivers and Restaurants after the Drivers and Restaurants accept a transaction request and the Drivers' and Restaurants' ability to cancel the transaction lapses. End-users access the Platform for free and the Company has no performance obligation to end-users. As a result, end-users are not the Company's customers.The Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy the Company\u2019s sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Restaurants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.Judgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers and Restaurants and end-users. The Company evaluates the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether it controls the service provided to the end-user and is the principal (i.e. \"gross\"), or the Company arranges for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and is an agent (i.e. \"net\"). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and discounts and promotions offered to end-users.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 514881, "end_char_idx": 517545, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d036905a-36ff-48ab-8d85-56747ace6d29": {"__data__": {"id_": "d036905a-36ff-48ab-8d85-56747ace6d29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f64d74a-fa49-469f-905b-6bee8024c207", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "900460db1d2bca62a9d2984651ca512fea8b9e29d409cc32d01fcde9df4a1921", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a5c6ef1d-8918-43c3-b76b-cafbd63f0e13", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfe7862831b60f59448d7aabe3a3bd391ee127bb0c1c8202f29847359c596993", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\"gross\"), or the Company arranges for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and is an agent (i.e. \"net\"). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and discounts and promotions offered to end-users. For Rides and Eats transactions, the Company's role is to provide the service to Drivers and Restaurants to facilitate a successful trip or Eats service to end-users. The Company concluded it does not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Restaurants to end-users as (i) the Company does not pre-purchase or otherwise obtain control of the Drivers' and Restaurants' goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) the Company does not direct Drivers and Restaurants to perform the service on the Company\u2019s behalf, and Drivers and Restaurants have the sole ability to decline a transaction request and (iii) the Company does not integrate services provided by Drivers and Restaurants with its other services and then provide them to end-users. As part of the Company's evaluation of control, the Company reviews other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions. The Company is not primarily responsible for Rides and Eats services provided to end-users, nor does it have inventory risk related to these services. While the Company facilitates setting the price for Rides and Eats services, the Drivers and Restaurants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does not result in the Company controlling the services provided to end-users.Drivers and Restaurants are the Company's customers and pay the Company a service fee for each successfully completed transaction with end-users. The Company's obligation in the transaction is satisfied upon completion by Drivers and Restaurants of a transaction. In the vast majority of transactions with end-users, the Company acts as an agent by connecting end-users seeking Rides and Eats services with Drivers and Restaurants looking to provide these services. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue on a net basis, representing the fee the Company expects to receive in exchange for the Company providing the service to Drivers and Restaurants. The Company records refunds to end-users that it recovers from Drivers and Restaurants as a reduction to revenue.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 517291, "end_char_idx": 519670, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5c6ef1d-8918-43c3-b76b-cafbd63f0e13": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5c6ef1d-8918-43c3-b76b-cafbd63f0e13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d036905a-36ff-48ab-8d85-56747ace6d29", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "86ea9439a6c4b5abcef2ef614f468124701a3442e5bf4d942e92cabbd5757ced", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a09a8e7-d880-4896-8890-f6b70e6431db", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "34b39383047dba6af7b029308f42df85d69173eb81278352686bbf243050966f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue on a net basis, representing the fee the Company expects to receive in exchange for the Company providing the service to Drivers and Restaurants.

The Company recognizes revenue when a trip is complete. Depending on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Rides Drivers. In markets where the Company earns the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Rides Drivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while the Company pays Rides Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing services provided. Therefore, the Company can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction. The Company typically receives the service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a trip.In addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips. On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Rides Drivers. The Company generally collects its service fee from Rides Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Rides Drivers, including Rides Drivers incentives. As the Company currently has limited means to collect its service fee for cash trips and cannot control whether Rides Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, it concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until collected from Rides Drivers.EatsThe Company derives its Eats revenue primarily from service fees paid by Delivery People and Restaurants for use of the platform and related service to successfully complete a meal delivery service via the Platform.

FreightThe Company derives its Freight revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers. Revenue for Freight represents the gross amount of fees charged to Shippers for these services. Costs incurred with carriers for Freight transportation are recorded in cost of revenue.Shippers contract with the Company to utilize the Company's network of independent freight carriers to transport freight. The Company enters into contracts with Shippers that define the price for each shipment and payment terms. The Company\u2019s acceptance of the shipment request establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each contract. By accepting the Shipper's order, the Company has responsibility for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination. The Company enters into separate contracts with independent freight carriers and is responsible for prompt payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless of payment by the Shipper. The Company\u2019s sole performance obligation is the transport of Shipper freight using its network of independent freight carriers. The Company invoices the Shipper upon satisfaction of the performance obligation.Judgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or agent in transactions with Shippers. For each contract entered into with a Shipper, the Company is responsible for identifying and directing independent freight carriers to transport the Shipper's goods. The Company therefore controls the service before it is transferred to the Shipper. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract with the Shipper, including having discretion in selecting a qualified independent freight carrier that meets the Shipper's specifications. The Company also has pricing discretion and negotiates separately the price(s) charged to Shippers and amounts paid to carriers. Accordingly, the Company is the principal in these transactions.In consideration for the Company\u2019s Freight services, Shippers pay the Company a fixed amount for each completed shipment.

Other Bets E-Bikes and ScootersThe Company derives its New Mobility revenue from operating leases as defined within ASC 842, \"Leases\" (\"ASC 842\"). New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provide users with access to rides through a variety of modes, including dockless e-93bikes and e-scooters (\u201cNew Mobility\u201d). New Mobility also includes Transit, UberWorks and the Company\u2019s Platform Incubator group, which is responsible for innovating new services and use cases on the Company\u2019s platform to drive long-term growth and cross-platform customer engagement. Users contract with the Company via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. The Company is responsible for providing access to the e-bikes and scooters over the user\u2019s desired period of use. The Company records lease payments received upon completion of each trip.Vehicle Solutions RevenuesThe Company leases vehicles to third parties who could potentially use them to provide ridesharing services. The Company disposed of its primary leased vehicle activities in 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019. Refer to Note 19 - Divestitures for additional details surrounding this transaction. The Company recognizes revenue from these arrangements as lease payments are collected.

Incentives to Drivers that are not for a distinct good or service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the Drivers, at the time or as they are earned by the Drivers, depending on the type of incentive. Since incentives are earned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.Incentives earned by Drivers for referring new Drivers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. The Company expenses such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company applied the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 and expenses costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is established using amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to Drivers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 were $199 million, $136 million, and $103 million, respectively.The Company evaluates whether the cumulative amount of payments, including incentives, to Drivers that are not in exchange for a distinct good or service received from Drivers exceeds the cumulative revenue earned since inception of the Drivers relationships.

These are offered in various forms of discounts and promotions and include:Targeted end-user discounts and promotions: These discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage, or generally increase end-users use of the platform, and are akin to a coupon. An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or meal deliveries during a limited time period. The Company records the cost of these discounts and promotions as sales and marketing expenses at the time they are redeemed by the end-user.End-user referrals: These referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platform and the new end-user takes their first ride on the platform. These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referring end-user. These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to the Platform. The Company records the liability for these referrals and corresponding expense as sales and marketing expenses at the time the referral is earned by the referring end-user. Market-wide promotions: These promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by Drivers and Restaurants to end-users for all or substantially all rides or meal deliveries in a specific market. This also includes any discounts offered under the Rides Pass and certain discounts within the Uber Rewards programs, which enable End-users to receive 94a fixed fare or a discount on all eligible rides. Accordingly, the Company records the cost of these promotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the trip is completed.OtherThe Company has elected to exclude from revenue, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and are concurrent with specific revenue producing transactions, and collected from Drivers and Restaurants and remitted to governmental authorities.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 528889, "end_char_idx": 531281, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "def91c17-bd2b-4a9c-858a-7086a1633280": {"__data__": {"id_": "def91c17-bd2b-4a9c-858a-7086a1633280", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f95a1c93-6a0d-4c8b-96b1-fe48d07751eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "a390f85f52a1ecfaf78bcdacb65cb5836e0e99155e4355bac498af55897f6553", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d76a7662-87be-4149-bc40-03bd4cf14fcc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6c919bb6592ee5eb91f2f68189a47320dcaae66887a7c360ef6b8e0393000c12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Accordingly, such amounts are not included as a component of revenue or cost of revenue.Practical ExpedientsThe Company has utilized the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. The Company has no significant financing components in its contracts with customers.Stock-Based CompensationThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of GAAP, which requires compensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. The Company accounts for\u00a0forfeitures\u00a0when they occur. The fair value of stock-based awards, granted or modified, is determined on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques.Service-Based AwardsThe Company records stock-based compensation expense for service-based stock options and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years.For stock options with service-based vesting conditions only and stock purchase rights provided under the Company's employee stock purchase plan, the valuation model, typically the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates. The Company estimates the volatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly traded companies in its industry group. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected term. The Company estimates the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be \"plain vanilla\" options, as the Company's historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. The Company estimates the expected term for non-employees based on the contractual term. The expected risk-free interest rate is based on the United States (\"U.S.\") Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is 0.0% as the Company has not paid and does not anticipate paying dividends on its common stock.Performance-Based AwardsThe Company has granted restricted common stock awards (\"RSA(s)\"), RSUs, stock appreciation rights (\u201cSAR(s)\u201d), stock options, and warrants that vest upon the satisfaction of both service-based and performance-based conditions.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 531282, "end_char_idx": 534004, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d76a7662-87be-4149-bc40-03bd4cf14fcc": {"__data__": {"id_": "d76a7662-87be-4149-bc40-03bd4cf14fcc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "def91c17-bd2b-4a9c-858a-7086a1633280", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "25fc5c41e35c2253e944d1f99e2314206046ce93a165ee0c482be5b7b6ed9cf9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6e639cf3-49db-48ad-a031-cb600a4a6837", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "743be1c55b009b81cd89e7ae4d823c379db01b1b887bd011c1f20c15518345e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The service-based condition for these awards generally is satisfied over four years.

The Company obtained contemporaneous third-party valuations to assist the Board of Directors in determining fair value. These contemporaneous third-party valuations used the methodologies, approaches and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.Factors taken into consideration in assessing the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock included: the sale of the Company's shares to investors in private offerings; the prices of the recent redeemable convertible preferred stock sales to investors in arm\u2019s-length transactions; the Company\u2019s capital resources and financial condition; the preferences held by the Company\u2019s redeemable convertible preferred stock classes in favor of its common stock; the likelihood and timing of achieving a qualifying event, such as an IPO or sale of the Company given prevailing market conditions; the Company\u2019s historical operating and financial performance as well as the Company\u2019s estimates of future financial performance; valuations of comparable companies; the hiring of key personnel; the status of the Company\u2019s development, product introduction and sales efforts; the price paid by the Company to repurchase outstanding shares; industry information such as market growth and volume and macro-economic events; and, additional objective and subjective factors relating to its business.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 538574, "end_char_idx": 541173, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cabc1ad1-82c6-41ab-83c2-bd4bcc1949a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "cabc1ad1-82c6-41ab-83c2-bd4bcc1949a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa6302a3-9c3a-4189-8500-70893c9673fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "09d9e41e003239194140379b2881143713bbae1d2424bc17933fe2708cedfc9f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ce295969-94ec-4366-b41d-84a1d84a0faf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4e5420640dc2c64a8912b3e99ae4437357abe8d18015d9f7dddafce519ef1d66", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered.The Company accounts for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately 96depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company\u2019s judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the Company\u2019s income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. The Company elected the tax law ordering approach in assessing the realizability of net operating losses expected to offset future Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d).The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets.

The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, the Company may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach.The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable data used in this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.Once the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d) is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by the Company. The model involves making assumptions around the investees\u2019 expected time to liquidity and volatility.An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in the Company\u2019s estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions during 2018 and 2019. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on the Company\u2019s estimate of fair value.The following table summarizes information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement for the Company\u2019s Grab investment as of December 31, 2018 and 2019:Fair value method\u00a0Relative weighting\u00a0Key unobservable inputFinancing transactions\u00a0100%\u00a0Transaction price per share\u00a0$6.16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Volatility\u00a048% - 54%\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Estimated time to liquidity\u00a01.0 - 2.5 yearsThe Company determines realized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities on a specific identification method.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 570228, "end_char_idx": 572795, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58412a44-12fe-430c-b08c-647c1adb7a9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "58412a44-12fe-430c-b08c-647c1adb7a9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b52ca48e-288a-4794-9b76-f3c42b9b7816", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "4b8ba103db7b8990a20b1a623d19b82721bed9260890b36f1aff058d607049c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3381e11a-a4b0-4c07-9864-600ed5d64b3a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "93b3d9bbe144fb1d74629e6e5d14be5f6032e43aabdab7021074c80b0d5618e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Company did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment losses during years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019.The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company\u2019s financial assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of December\u00a031, 2019, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):\u00a0\u00a0Non-marketableDebt Securities\u00a0Non-marketableEquity SecuritiesBalance as of December 31, 2018\u00a0$2,370\u00a0$\u2014Total net gains (losses)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Included in earnings\u00a0(8)\u00a011Included in other comprehensive income (loss)\u00a04\u00a0\u2014Purchases (1)\u00a04\u00a056Transfers (2)\u00a0\u2014\u00a031Balance as of December 31, 2019\u00a0$2,370\u00a0$98(1) Purchases of non\u2013marketable equity security include warrants to purchase shares of a private company that vest as certain performance criteria are met during the period.(2) Transfers include a non-marketable equity security that was previously measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of December\u00a031, 2018 for which the Company elected to apply the fair value option during the year ended December 31, 2019.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 572796, "end_char_idx": 573846, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3381e11a-a4b0-4c07-9864-600ed5d64b3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3381e11a-a4b0-4c07-9864-600ed5d64b3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "58412a44-12fe-430c-b08c-647c1adb7a9c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "7381357ea708ad73f4f8fcc626f40520838ebe2387e627b1963f763bbb8c299c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ccc0372a-18d8-4f73-8016-2b58239db657", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2784122e4fc0c2f6f7e44a6fc7db08e582b5f6b07b77a45be6d33d5d7cc8eaf5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(2) Transfers include a non-marketable equity security that was previously measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of December\u00a031, 2018 for which the Company elected to apply the fair value option during the year ended December 31, 2019.

As a result of the repatriation, the deferred tax assets were recalculated at the U.S. statutory tax rate, resulting in a total deferred tax benefit of $275 million. The rate differential between the foreign subsidiary and the United States resulted in this deferred tax benefit.The 2019 rate impact for \u201cEntity restructuring\u201d is related to a series of transactions resulting in changes to the Company\u2019s international legal structure, including a redomiciliation of a subsidiary to the Netherlands and a transfer of certain intellectual property rights among wholly owned subsidiaries, primarily to align its evolving operations. The redomiciliation resulted in a step-up in the tax basis of intellectual property rights and a correlated increase in foreign deferred tax assets in an amount of $6.4 billion, net of a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $1.4 billion (refer to the 2019 rate impact for \u201cChange in unrecognized tax benefits\u201d).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 636036, "end_char_idx": 638031, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ee30233-9e66-4e96-9093-79ebcd37c421": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ee30233-9e66-4e96-9093-79ebcd37c421", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b59bde83-1712-4a5b-98cd-dd23abc8b50d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "9768a6035420443a9ec7fa30770d59d83f2426c0be3f88caa13287601f3a2e7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "db406c2a-9c40-4e76-b87b-261fbd1f0b76", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d66c305be6bf5d3b54023c1fd349b7c866d15c74e9a52b32aa9cc0be14a91f54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Based on available objective evidence, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that these additional foreign deferred tax assets will be realizable as of December 31, 2019 and, therefore, are offset by a full valuation allowance (refer to the 2019 rate impact for \u201cValuation allowance\u201d) to the extent not offset by reserves for uncertain tax positions.

The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. The Company\u2019s judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the Company\u2019s income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. The Company had a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of $1.3 billion and $9.9 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the increase in valuation allowance was primarily attributable to a step-up in the tax basis of intellectual property rights, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations, and tax credits generated during the year.The indefinite carryforward period for net operating losses (\"NOLs\") means that indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities can be considered as support for realization of deferred tax assets including post December 31, 2017 net operating loss carryovers, which can affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2018 and 2019, the Company realized approximately $920 million and $979 million, respectively, of its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of its indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities being used as a source of income.As of December\u00a031, 2019, the Company had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $2.9 billion that begin to expire in 2031 and $5.9 billion that have an unlimited carryover period.

The remaining $1.7 billion of the unrecognized tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. During 2019, the Company settled the IRS audit for the tax years 2013 and 2014.

Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, the Company is unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under various state and other foreign income tax examinations. The Company believes that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period.As of December\u00a031, 2019, the open tax years for the Company\u2019s major tax jurisdictions are as follows:Jurisdiction\u00a0Tax YearsU.S. Federal\u00a02011 - 2019U.S. States\u00a02010 - 2019Brazil\u00a02014 - 2019Netherlands\u00a02013 - 2019United Kingdom\u00a02014 - 2019Australia\u00a02015 - 2019India\u00a02012 - 2019In 2019, the Company reevaluated its indefinite reinvestment assertion with regards to accumulated foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and concluded that it intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately $250 million. The amount of potential unrecognized deferred tax liability with respect to such unremitted earnings is not material. Due to the one-time transition tax and the imposition of the GILTI provisions, all previously unremitted earnings will no longer be subject to U.S. federal income tax; however, there could be U.S. state and/or foreign withholding taxes upon distribution of such unremitted earnings.

During the third quarter of 2019, following a number of leadership and organizational changes, the CODM changed how he assesses performance and allocates resources to a more disaggregated level in order to optimize utilization of the Company\u2019s platform as well as manage research and development of new technologies. Based on this change, in the third quarter of 2019, the Company determined it has five operating and reportable segments and revised prior comparative periods to conform to the current period segment presentation.

Rides also includes activity related to our Uber for Business (\"U4B\"), Financial Partnerships, and Vehicle Solutions offerings.EatsThe Eats offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered.FreightFreight connects carriers with shippers on the Company\u2019s platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment.Other BetsThe Other Bets segment consists of multiple investment stage offerings. The largest investment within the segment is the Company\u2019s New Mobility offering that refers to products that provide consumers with access to rides through a variety of modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. It also includes Transit, UberWorks and the Company\u2019s Platform Incubator group. ATG and Other Technology ProgramsThe ATG and Other Technology Programs segment is responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle and ridesharing technologies, as well as Uber Elevate.For information about how the Company\u2019s reportable segments derive revenue, refer to Note 2 - Revenue.The Company\u2019s segment operating performance measure is segment adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, the Company does not report asset information by segment.

The Company has existing litigation, including class actions, PAGA lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit proceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors.

With respect to the Company\u2019s outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on its current knowledge, the Company believes that the ultimate amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

If one or more of these matters were resolved against the Company for amounts in excess of management's expectations, the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows\u00a0could be materially adversely affected.AB5In January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the \u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.130The Company has received lawsuits and governmental inquiries relating to AB5, and anticipates - in California and in other jurisdictions - future claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, and government investigations and audits challenging the Company\u2019s classification of Drivers as independent contractors and not employees. The Company believes that its current and historical approach to classification is supported by the law and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. However, the results of litigation and arbitration are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these matters can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors. The Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss at this time.O\u2019Connor, et al., v. Uber Technologies, Inc. and Yucesoy v.

The Company has filed a petition with an administrative law judge of the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board appealing the assessment.In 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor (NJDOL) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent contractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply.

LevandowskiOn October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach of their respective employment agreements with Google, fraud and other state law violations (due to soliciting Google employees and starting a new venture to compete with Google\u2019s business in contravention of their respective employment agreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. The arbitration hearing was held from April 30 to May 11, 2018. On March 26, 2019, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google\u2019s former employees and awarding $127 million against Anthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are 131jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted its request for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel\u2019s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. Google and Lior Ron have entered into a settlement agreement which resolves the entirety of Ron\u2019s liability. While Uber and Levandowski are parties to an indemnification agreement, whether Uber is ultimately responsible for such indemnification is subject to a dispute between the Company and Levandowski. The ultimate resolution of the matter could result in a possible loss of up to $64 million or more (depending on interest incurred) in excess of the amount accrued. Uber is not a party to either of these arbitrations.Taiwan Regulatory FinesPrior to the Company adjusting and re-launching its operating model in April 2017 to a model where government-approved rental companies provide transport services to Riders, Drivers in Taiwan and the local Uber entity have been fined by Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Transportation and Communications in significant numbers across Taiwan.

The tax data covers calendar years 2015 and prior. The prosecutor indicted four Drivers as test cases which have been heard by the Copenhagen City Court, the Appeal Court and finally the Supreme Court. In addition, on October 6, 2017, the Company was preliminary charged with aiding and abetting illegal taxi traffic in 2015. In September 2018, the Danish Supreme Court ruled on these test cases that the Drivers were carrying out illegal taxi operations and fined them in the total amount of their earnings from performing ridesharing services. The Court also confirmed that the use of the relevant tax data obtained from the Dutch tax authorities was validly used as evidence in the prosecutions and was used to assess the fines payable.In January 2018, the Company received another request from the Danish tax authorities through the Dutch tax authorities to disclose tax data about Drivers for years 2016 and 2017. Such tax data for years 2016 to 2017 has subsequently been provided by the Company to the Danish tax authorities.On May 29, 2018, the Company received another set of indictment papers from the Danish prosecutor.

Uber Technologies, Inc.Seven consolidated actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts by taxi medallion owners Malden Transportation, Inc., Anoush Cab, Inc., Dot Ave Cab, Inc., Gill & Gill, Inc., Max Luc Taxi, Inc., Sycoone Taxi, Inc., Taxi Maintenance, Inc. in late 2016 and early 2017 against the Company alleging unfair competition violations (on the grounds that the Company failed to comply with local taxi laws), as well as state and federal antitrust violations (on the grounds that the Company prices trips below cost in order to achieve a monopoly). Antitrust claims were dismissed, but the unfair competition claims remained. On May 15, 2019, Uber reached a tentative settlement with the plaintiffs in six of the seven actions, which are finalized as to all but one plaintiff. A bench trial of the seventh action (Anoush Cab, Inc.) began on July 18, 2019 and concluded on August 2, 2019. On September 6, 2019, the Court issued a complete defense verdict, resolving that trial in the Company\u2019s favor and finding no liability. On October 4, 2019, the Anoush plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal.Swiss Social Security ReclassificationSeveral Swiss government bodies currently classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier Operations B.V. or of Uber B.V. for social security or regulatory purposes.

A number of such decisions have been made by these governmental bodies. The Company is challenging each of them.

This ruling was not appealed and the Swiss governmental bodies continue to investigate the identity of the employer.

Any possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.Non-Income Tax Matters The Company recorded an estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and is under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regard to such matters. The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from the Company\u2019s transactions with its Drivers, as well as the tax treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with Drivers, disputes involve the applicability of transactional taxes (such as sales, value added and similar taxes) to services provided, as well as the applicability of withholding tax on payments made to such Drivers. For example, the Company is involved in a proceeding in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking to classify the Company as a transportation provider. Being classified as a transportation provider would result in a VAT (20%) on Gross Bookings or on the service fee that the Company charges Drivers, both retroactively and prospectively. Further, if Drivers are determined to be workers, they may be entitled to additional benefits and payments, and the Company may be subject to penalties, back taxes, and fines. The Company believes that the position of HMRC and the regulators in similar disputes and audits is without merit and is defending itself vigorously. The Company\u2019s estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial processes in certain jurisdictions, therefore, the final outcome could be different from the estimated liability recorded.Other Legal and Regulatory MattersThe Company has been subject to various government inquiries and investigations surrounding the legality of certain of the Company\u2019s business practices, compliance with antitrust and other global regulatory requirements, labor laws, data protection and privacy laws, the adequacy of disclosures to investors and other shareholders, and the infringement of certain intellectual property rights.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 674425, "end_char_idx": 677162, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ffccfab-38f6-4b33-88df-e0d20e47030b": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ffccfab-38f6-4b33-88df-e0d20e47030b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2a0132f-b37f-493f-8669-8c3a5d273149", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "89f5ee4791a6d2ce774abf7a3f344bb17904ed3d76abbc003372f47d4104cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf72ba2c-2dd3-4801-9bc6-9522f7a051a4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "df1e4d277819ea3f695a0f17d11e72d3b5e0d02afbc8d395b91e20275d67f3ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3f40776d-62c0-4be6-9f8c-cbd83a3f3746", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca0f84b75dafa079060cf9a9ca1f8556a05247aa8d90e7217466f85b13a7513c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Company has investigated many of these matters and is implementing a number of recommendations to its managerial, operational and compliance practices, as well as seeking to strengthen its overall governance structure.

The maximum collective guarantee liability is up to $50 million.The Company evaluated the nature of its investment in ECOP and determined that ECOP was a VIE during the construction period; however, the Company is not the primary beneficiary as decisions are made jointly between parties and therefore does not have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIE.

In exchange, the Company received 401 million shares of Grab Series G preferred stock on the closing date of the transaction and 8 million additional Grab Series G preferred stock during 2018 related to the resolution of certain post-close contingencies, for a total of 409 million shares representing 23.2% of the outstanding share capital of Grab as of December\u00a031, 2018. In addition, based on the agreement, 3 million shares remained subject to the post-close contingency as of December\u00a031, 2018, and the remaining number of shares were immaterial as of December\u00a031, 2019. The shares received have been recorded at fair value as additional sale consideration.

During the year ended December\u00a031, 2018, the Company transferred certain vehicles to Grab in exchange for SGD 31 million of cash consideration and recognized a loss on disposal of SGD 9 million. In January 2019, the Company transferred the remaining vehicles under the Grab Vehicle Purchase Agreement to Grab in exchange for SGD 39 million of cash consideration. The Company and Grab executed a Transition Service Agreement (\u201cTSA\u201d) which requires the Company to provide transaction and integration services to Grab for a period of up to six months subsequent to the\u00a0closing of the divestiture. In addition, the Company entered into a TSA with MLU B.V. to provide certain transition services subsequent to the\u00a0closing of the transaction. Transactions related to the TSAs did not have material impacts on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.Xchange LeasingIn August 2017, the Company began a reassessment of its U.S. based wholly-owned car leasing operations Xchange Leasing resulting in a plan to exit operations.
