BUSINESSOverviewUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). We connect consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connect Riders and other consumers (\u201cEater(s)\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Our technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).Our SegmentsAs of December\u00a031, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.MobilityMobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 65167, "end_char_idx": 67648, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82664c10-989b-4177-8712-a7a16516bde3": {"__data__": {"id_": "82664c10-989b-4177-8712-a7a16516bde3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d70ce253-1f5a-44b7-92e8-d9326220423b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6b1e7e737017acf6b9c29de61707b23a8073d12ecbb85aa63fa3787b2c7ec82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a9fa030e-8eb0-4d01-94a9-74ef96128248", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "8756a38081dda21675e9e4f3976b399617284bd4bbf895412ea2ad990c0fecfb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aa165973-e535-43ad-a4d5-cd5812ff5b1d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "67119ede72ec47a48a1f689ccf3da924764a8a7cf5a07847d38a67717fd581f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.MobilityMobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.We believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates. At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.DeliveryOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launched our Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Delivery enables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on our platform.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 67372, "end_char_idx": 69723, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa165973-e535-43ad-a4d5-cd5812ff5b1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa165973-e535-43ad-a4d5-cd5812ff5b1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d70ce253-1f5a-44b7-92e8-d9326220423b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6b1e7e737017acf6b9c29de61707b23a8073d12ecbb85aa63fa3787b2c7ec82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "82664c10-989b-4177-8712-a7a16516bde3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "5f42f74d979c3fd95d610d3d4e56e88e7e3ac58c8f2680dab8be3f8d9abfe756", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cd1669bf-d9c2-4fb9-a049-824a4e1ed47e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "51d9e764733d0c7e0718129fad8be6cef198a5fdaad08bb06ec0a5fbc7fb4656", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "For example, Delivery enables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times.

In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.During 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d) in an all-stock transaction. The acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. We also completed the acquisition of The Drizly Group, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d), allowing us to expand alcohol offerings in our Delivery business with Drizly\u2019s leading platform, technology, scale, and expertise. The acquisition of Drizly has been accounted for as a business combination. For additional information, see Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.FreightWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles, 4which are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 69368, "end_char_idx": 71921, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd1669bf-d9c2-4fb9-a049-824a4e1ed47e": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd1669bf-d9c2-4fb9-a049-824a4e1ed47e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d70ce253-1f5a-44b7-92e8-d9326220423b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6b1e7e737017acf6b9c29de61707b23a8073d12ecbb85aa63fa3787b2c7ec82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa165973-e535-43ad-a4d5-cd5812ff5b1d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "e7630ead2b426e6839b6e333755aaf9c07fbbf5520fd701607d20fd6406e7241", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8eb86486-3036-4b47-b1d4-ff3974e51834", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "718fefd8d4f67e20dbf94c83c6331025e2bd4da1bf93c395647cb155c9b8e469", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end.

We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.During 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc.

Together, these elements power movement from point A to point B.Massive NetworkOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip. In approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of a button for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people.Leading TechnologyWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies.

Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users. For example, Delivery attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December\u00a031, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our platform. Additionally, for the three months ended December\u00a031, 2021, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 12.6 Trips per month on average, compared to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. We believe that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.With our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the United States as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priority service, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings.

We are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlocking cross-platform advertising formats. During the fourth quarter of 2021, active advertising merchants grew to over 170,000.Competitive EnvironmentWe compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize 5these industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:\u2022Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\u2022Delivery.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 76024, "end_char_idx": 78353, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "862541cd-81f9-41fb-a93e-aeacf1967197": {"__data__": {"id_": "862541cd-81f9-41fb-a93e-aeacf1967197", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d70ce253-1f5a-44b7-92e8-d9326220423b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6b1e7e737017acf6b9c29de61707b23a8073d12ecbb85aa63fa3787b2c7ec82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "16e7f8f4-f183-4541-b0a5-e6d7870c539a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "0a52cabf91d1ab65ee565e05fd847fcb0daa5d9adf77ac6f55038260379f2018", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ad6ae56b-db90-4553-93fa-b276b14c4d15", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f1f663427bab4ab369dcadf5e4d9053b03f4631048e5ff3bf9561cfcb5551dc4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\u2022Delivery.

This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model. Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (\u201cTNC\u201d) regulations.\u00a0These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations.\u00a0These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.In addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, the parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work.

Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.\u2022In January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers.

We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns.

As a result of COVID-19, in 2020, we asked that all employees who were able to do so work remotely and while we subsequently announced return to office dates, the dynamic COVID situation disrupted our return to office plans\u2014although many of our offices are open, we have not yet set an updated return to office date. Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees. As a result, we found that some employees were struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress and social isolation, and we experienced higher levels of attrition. The issues of stress and balance were particularly exacerbated among caregivers of young children. To address some of these concerns, we strengthened our work-from-home policies and looked for new ways to support our employees as they navigated this crisis in their personal and professional lives. We provided 8more attention and flexibility to caregivers by providing resources, tools, and support, and amplified our focus on mental health and well-being.Employee Engagement. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging and are able to achieve to their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveys and related tools. We historically conducted a semi-annual workforce survey that measures employee engagement, overall satisfaction, and well-being. But in 2021, we made a shift toward continuous listening by launching an employee survey, sent out to a rotating third of employees every month.

We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged, satisfied, and productive. Employees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uber through internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable them to have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs and resources that promote wellness and productivity. This helps our diverse employee base manage life\u2019s expected and unexpected events. Globally, Uber offers competitive benefits packages to our employees and their families.

A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with, traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.Accessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.\u2022Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber\u2014and other app based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples of our advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\u25e6In the United States, European Union, and Canada, we put forward proposals to improve the quality of independent work, calling on policymakers, platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work\u2014one where having access to protections and benefits doesn\u2019t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.\u25e6In California, we welcomed the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements for platform companies like Uber to provide benefits, including healthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.\u25e6In the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 99467, "end_char_idx": 102264, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22b73f7b-214f-48ab-96fd-97ead2401a0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "22b73f7b-214f-48ab-96fd-97ead2401a0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d70ce253-1f5a-44b7-92e8-d9326220423b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6b1e7e737017acf6b9c29de61707b23a8073d12ecbb85aa63fa3787b2c7ec82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8992f69-72f8-4e02-a3a6-539e4cbe9553", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "927443c34cd08502852d7eb39c9a56228070f30975f52b8b576226b220c9e3bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "73a0d0fd-299a-48ab-8039-454dd4ea3cb1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "63714c7519e7cb2b5679294b36a6d6669d0b88869ad55c52d193e4826337e93d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Pursuant to this change, drivers who use Uber\u2019s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paid holiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible.

We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions. Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or 13expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $372 million as of December\u00a031, 2021. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.Changes to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 121053, "end_char_idx": 123874, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a3a7a72-083a-4780-bffd-f569629e9cde": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a3a7a72-083a-4780-bffd-f569629e9cde", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d70ce253-1f5a-44b7-92e8-d9326220423b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6b1e7e737017acf6b9c29de61707b23a8073d12ecbb85aa63fa3787b2c7ec82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a21190ee-bd3e-41bd-8e94-2f11e9053821", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "f4de8299f04143c52b4c7847e76df2446e54fc60bb8bba916fbed096fc930a37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cef03e5f-0e39-4050-b5a4-eb2b6d261605", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4487a3c60e1f5f0aebcc43f4ed474121f3632df99882a967e801fe01677be3b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In August 2020, the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, and while the California Court of Appeal subsequently affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, on April 12, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation to dissolve the injunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.We face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices.

Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather than self-employed).

Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid holiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.In addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations.

These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. In addition, other jurisdictions such as Seattle have passed, or may consider or pass regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.In 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our operating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from airports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and from airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips.

Additionally, since April 2019, Mexico City\u2019s Secretar\u00eda de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operational requirements, including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC data sharing requirement and a requirement that Drivers in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle inspection, we have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.Traditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require us to comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission implemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Council voted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire vehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 264984, "end_char_idx": 267433, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5cc814d-f668-40bb-8da2-fb448cee1e17": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5cc814d-f668-40bb-8da2-fb448cee1e17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d70ce253-1f5a-44b7-92e8-d9326220423b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6b1e7e737017acf6b9c29de61707b23a8073d12ecbb85aa63fa3787b2c7ec82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b1c9b96-b2f8-467f-b76e-a05dfc192369", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "9273012e809ec6ff3eef78f3e5c555996d085870a75d31610a6f0201551997b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "19c5ea71-c164-4c20-ab3e-a71e855f3062", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be42f2d29662e9c2e3b9c7a12187e77de4fe4a58a0f057b384351353750cc64f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In August 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruising cap,\u201d intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City. Although such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago.

Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making.

Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action against businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S. states have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil provides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.

We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The claim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny these allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.Other Legal ProceedingsWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business.

Various governmental restrictions, including the declaration of a federal National Emergency, multiple cities\u2019 and states\u2019 declarations of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the global demand for Mobility rides. Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to be impacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 Response InitiativesWe continue to prioritize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we serve and continue to believe we will play an important role in the economic recovery of cities around the globe. We are focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs. The pandemic has reduced the demand for our Mobility offering globally, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings. We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by launching new, or expanding existing, services or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.To comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended our shared rides Mobility offering in most markets, and implemented \u201cleave at door\u201d delivery options for Delivery offerings.

Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws.

In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.In January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional, which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services has also filed an appeal.To comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.Also of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y.

Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and we have no performance obligation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Judgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). We have concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery transactions. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver IncentivesWe offer various incentive programs to Drivers.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 409942, "end_char_idx": 412776, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ddad6c9e-f26f-4166-9842-a254579ad3e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "ddad6c9e-f26f-4166-9842-a254579ad3e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d70ce253-1f5a-44b7-92e8-d9326220423b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6b1e7e737017acf6b9c29de61707b23a8073d12ecbb85aa63fa3787b2c7ec82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "264c74ea-ca06-43d1-b2d4-578abe54dfa7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "401388989f4b54fbb163d6adcc110abaf63852f85026a7928d67ef49317afa3e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e39f6e65-9fc0-4d80-ae7e-468b6c63d747", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ddcb8cff6219b037edc4ea90bfabb262903fc188a6171baddfafc4b045deadd5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected.

Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service received. Incentives offered in exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.End-User Discounts and PromotionsWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotions which are recorded as a reduction of revenue.Business CombinationsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology, and trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful lives, and discount rates.Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Embedded DerivativesDuring 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 412494, "end_char_idx": 415352, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e39f6e65-9fc0-4d80-ae7e-468b6c63d747": {"__data__": {"id_": "e39f6e65-9fc0-4d80-ae7e-468b6c63d747", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d70ce253-1f5a-44b7-92e8-d9326220423b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6b1e7e737017acf6b9c29de61707b23a8073d12ecbb85aa63fa3787b2c7ec82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ddad6c9e-f26f-4166-9842-a254579ad3e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "4fcdb8b2109cc1edfdea98d792bb43f6abe3b955a142267f311121698e4a09f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b59c79fb-e57b-472d-9a99-265b44c2c20a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0379af0baa4fa593f7c42f0e6c070d38295e1ed695bff8939d14866328898651", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Embedded DerivativesDuring 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. These embedded features are composed of conversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the total number of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features will have a fixed value. These conversion options are bifurcated from the underlying instrument and accounted for and valued separately from the host instrument. Embedded derivatives are recognized as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We measure these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.We value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the Qualified Initial Public Offering (\u201cQIPO\u201d) conversion option (\u201cQIPO Conversion Option\u201d). The fair value of these convertible 65notes with and without the QIPO Conversion Option is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow model to discount the expected payoffs at various potential QIPO dates to the valuation date. The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring at various points in time and the discount yield, which was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance date of these convertible notes. The discount rate is updated during each period to reflect the yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date. Upon closing of the IPO in May 2019, holders of these convertible notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into shares of common stock.

Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security\u2019s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors.

Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of the impairment charges.Goodwill Impairment AssessmentWe review goodwill for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Determination of reporting units is based on a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment managers review financial results, evaluate performance, and allocate resources.Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.Performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations, or government inquiries and investigations that may arise in the ordinary course of business.

We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method.

Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.

Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates.

In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.67Insurance ReservesWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers\u2019 compensation. The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided.

The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees. The majority of our outstanding RSUs, as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition. A small portion of the awards contains service-based vesting condition as well as performance-based vesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition for the majority of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of certain financial and operation metrics. The market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values. We account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures when they occur.We have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.These assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\u2022Expected term.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:Interest Rate RiskOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 432938, "end_char_idx": 435434, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17f4ab8a-7a89-4401-a320-60efa63afd7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "17f4ab8a-7a89-4401-a320-60efa63afd7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d70ce253-1f5a-44b7-92e8-d9326220423b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6b1e7e737017acf6b9c29de61707b23a8073d12ecbb85aa63fa3787b2c7ec82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5bbf6be9-d8f9-47f5-a40f-8dc14b04ba93", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "72eaafa854c0aa0f300ea4cf3bf3df20ce5bb791cb875abb6a1100f380bcb000", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c15f11fa-3631-4fe4-b65e-94bcee583014", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "91e52d01ba0a0301b0c4aa0b6d99d8ef155e3c7fc53036170ecd75c52cde2a46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 million as of December\u00a031, 2021.Investment Risk Our investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion as of December\u00a031, 2020 and December\u00a031, 2021, respectively. We did not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of December\u00a031, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.We are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the carrying value of our investments was $12.6 billion, including equity method investments.Foreign Currency RiskWe transact business globally in multiple currencies.

Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.As described in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded The Drizly Group, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d) and Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2021.

Drizly and Transplace are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management\u2019s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting collectively represent approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 442111, "end_char_idx": 444865, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9898fa24-66fa-415a-9343-111b5ea385e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "9898fa24-66fa-415a-9343-111b5ea385e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d70ce253-1f5a-44b7-92e8-d9326220423b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6b1e7e737017acf6b9c29de61707b23a8073d12ecbb85aa63fa3787b2c7ec82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3238f041-4779-4b57-a8e0-b886dc3544d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "c71b11af382dd36ccf368d388bfd33ebd51c92d464eb85059c60bc1b31019cee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f31f8852-4a89-4ad2-bd14-25c3567df4f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e335bed118e6d5f6c84ec30bdf186f5ad9710f3a32fd8c96d7b7d26a5bbda166", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding 71prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company\u2019s revenue recognition process, including controls over the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of BusinessUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.Our technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).Basis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d).

Refer to Note 16 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of\u00a0goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting certain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in particular, our impairment assessment related to the determination of the fair values of certain investments and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the global financial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operations and financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit RiskCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject to credit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high credit quality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 469508, "end_char_idx": 472384, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f58da6d-74cf-4dbc-9d14-29bf7328339c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f58da6d-74cf-4dbc-9d14-29bf7328339c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d70ce253-1f5a-44b7-92e8-d9326220423b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6b1e7e737017acf6b9c29de61707b23a8073d12ecbb85aa63fa3787b2c7ec82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "71ea00d0-4ff4-466d-888f-8dfb928ed1fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "ead1f7e726dd68e0fbe554b934a12063dd8f436fe1198d21fe360214eceb86db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5fcc549b-5d4a-4e2c-bd3e-2e50625ec66a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f577302dc868e62b59e57fb6e440a8dd09291a9877d19851b3a4a1cecfd654eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high credit quality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of funds withheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims. We rely on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\u201cpayment service providers\u201d) to collect amounts due from end-users. Payment service providers are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality. No customers accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.Certain Significant Risks and UncertaintiesWe have incurred significant net losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of $23.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our operations have historically been funded through equity and debt financings. While management currently anticipates that our available cash and cash equivalents, and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, additional capital may need to be raised or additional indebtedness incurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives. We may not be able to obtain additional 82financing on favorable terms, if at all, or our ability to incur additional indebtedness may be restricted by the terms of our existing debt instruments.In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. COVID-19 has rapidly impacted market and economic conditions globally. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented, including business activities and travel restrictions, and \u201cshelter-at-home\u201d orders, that have had an adverse impact on our business and operations by reducing, in particular, the global demand for Mobility offerings, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it continues to produce around the world, it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results of operations, financial position, liquidity, and cash flows.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 472013, "end_char_idx": 474652, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5fcc549b-5d4a-4e2c-bd3e-2e50625ec66a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5fcc549b-5d4a-4e2c-bd3e-2e50625ec66a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d70ce253-1f5a-44b7-92e8-d9326220423b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6b1e7e737017acf6b9c29de61707b23a8073d12ecbb85aa63fa3787b2c7ec82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f58da6d-74cf-4dbc-9d14-29bf7328339c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "21e0fc448155b84c5e5b458a14e0e101f45915858e443b09409ab93b74047ead", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f310349a-d45f-4b3e-be8d-8b8729d0fb06", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "483d89ac46f6bf9fb5f3a02e021a2d10ed538bedb4d215cd672b0f4904528623", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it continues to produce around the world, it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results of operations, financial position, liquidity, and cash flows. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be further resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financial markets; governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behavior, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in checking and savings accounts as well as investments in money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate bonds. We consider all highly-liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash includes amounts collected on behalf of, but not yet remitted to Drivers and Merchants, which are included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents Restricted cash and cash equivalents are pledged as security for letters of credit or other collateral amounts established by us for certain insurance policies and also include cash and cash equivalents that are unavailable for immediate use due to legal and/or contractual restrictions. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are classified as current and non-current assets based on the contractual or estimated term of the remaining restriction.

We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from lease components, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an asset which we do not own. Right of use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate (\u201cIBR\u201d), because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable. The IBR is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis.

We adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, on a modified retrospective basis. Under ASC 326, at each reporting period, we evaluate our available-for-sale debt securities at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security\u2019s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors.

In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Level\u00a01\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level\u00a03\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Our primary financial instruments include cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, receivables, investments, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants. The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Refer to Note 3 \u2013 Investments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 \u2013 Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.Variable Interest EntitiesWe evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity. These evaluations are complex, involve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors.

Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether we are still the primary beneficiary.

We derive our revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of our platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services, including facilitating payments from end-users. The service enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the \u201cUber Service\u201d). Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we also generate revenue from end-users. We charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue from customers' use of Freight services. We periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.87Mobility and Delivery AgreementsWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform.

We evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e. \u201cgross\u201d), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. \u201cnet\u201d). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers. For the majority of Mobility and Delivery transactions, our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a successful trip or Delivery service to end-users. We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchase or otherwise obtain control of the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants to perform the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-users. As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions. We are not primarily responsible for Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services. While we facilitate setting the price for Mobility and Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does not result in us controlling the services provided to end-users.In the vast majority of transactions with end-users, we act as an agent of the Driver or Merchant by connecting end-users seeking Mobility and Delivery services with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services.

We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.

In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing services provided.

New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a variety of modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (\u201cNew Mobility\u201d). Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We were responsible for providing access to the e-bikes and e-scooters over the user\u2019s desired period of use. We recorded lease payments received upon completion of each trip. After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material. Refer to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures for further information on the JUMP Divestiture.Advanced Technologies Group (\u201cATG\u201d) and Other Technology Programs\u00a0Collaboration RevenueIn 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next\u2013generation self-driving technology. Under this collaboration agreement, we received cash consideration over the three-year term. We have applied ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements for recognition and presentation of the consideration received as collaboration revenue. Refer to Note 17 \u2013 Non-Controlling Interests for further information.Incentives to Customers Incentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received.

We expense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 and expense costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less.

We obtained contemporaneous third-party valuations to assist the Board of Directors in determining fair value. These contemporaneous third-party valuations used the methodologies, approaches and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.We account for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.

Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates utilized are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain.

Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the 98guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.Once the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the investees\u2019 expected time to liquidity and volatility.An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities on a specific identification method.

Our investment in Lime Common Stock and representation on Lime\u2019s board of directors gives us the ability to exercise significant influence over Lime. We elected to apply the fair value option to our Lime Common Stock investment and therefore we are applying fair value accounting to all of the 2020 Lime Investments which provides for consistency of accounting treatment. The 2020 Lime Investments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. The fair value of the 2020 Lime Investments as of December 31, 2020 of $134 million was determined by referencing a transaction in a convertible note that is junior to the Lime Convertible Note and used as an input to an OPM. Other key inputs to the OPM were discount rates of 22% and 28%, volatility of 67% and time to liquidity of 2.0 years.

A lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes of allocating value in the OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event would result in higher valuation (due to access to public markets and reduction in cost of capital), reduces valuation uncertainty, and generally assumes market and macro-economic conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario.

We contributed $136 million cash in exchange for a 45% interest in ECOP. The two LLC Partners own 45% and 10%, respectively. The equity ownership interest in ECOP remained at 45% as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.In March 2020, the two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries took out new loans. Upon closing of the new financing, the proceeds were used to first pay off the existing construction loan, then to cover the required operation reserve as well as various financing costs, and last, the remaining proceeds were distributed back to Uber and the LLC Partners based on their ownership percentage. As a result, Uber received $91 million from the ECOP as a return of capital investment, and reduced the investment carrying value by the same amount. We have significant influence over ECOP and we account for our investment in ECOP under the equity method. At each reporting period and a quarter in arrears, we adjust the carrying value of our investment to reflect our proportionate share of ECOP\u2019s income or loss, and any impairments, with a corresponding credit or debit, respectively, to income or loss from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations.

These intercompany transfers did not have a material impact to the financial statements.121The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 are as follows (in millions):As of December 31,20202021Deferred tax assetsNet operating loss carryforwards$4,949\u00a0$5,992\u00a0Research and development credits857\u00a01,020\u00a0Stock-based compensation125\u00a066\u00a0Accruals and reserves227\u00a0290\u00a0Accrued legal95\u00a0119\u00a0Fixed assets and intangible assets6,936\u00a06,753\u00a0Investment in partnership254\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Lease liability460\u00a0455\u00a0Interest limitation carryforwards562\u00a0629\u00a0Other58\u00a0107\u00a0Total deferred tax assets14,523\u00a015,431\u00a0Less: Valuation allowance(13,410)(13,920)Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance1,113\u00a01,511\u00a0Deferred tax liabilitiesIndefinite lived deferred tax liability (1)1,502\u00a01,451\u00a0ROU assets322\u00a0334\u00a0Other68\u00a029\u00a0Total deferred tax liabilities1,892\u00a01,814\u00a0Net deferred tax liabilities$779\u00a0$303\u00a0(1) The $1.5 billion indefinite-lived deferred tax liability represents the deferred U.S.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 634447, "end_char_idx": 636537, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "806d3698-3c01-46dd-9dd9-051d6920276f": {"__data__": {"id_": "806d3698-3c01-46dd-9dd9-051d6920276f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d70ce253-1f5a-44b7-92e8-d9326220423b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6b1e7e737017acf6b9c29de61707b23a8073d12ecbb85aa63fa3787b2c7ec82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "05395f20-dd8b-42e0-8a7a-c94e02852bbb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "25ab3aad5fe273acef7229789679b8021bb66fb256ac46737b754907611e267c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "408f615e-ddc7-41a3-8c81-cb6dac0b1a8b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "58291abda8e660b709de23ef6c0ad5c51db7ca91a1748988aff390526cd01623", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "income tax expense, which will be incurred upon the eventual disposition of the shares underlying our investments in Didi, Aurora, Grab, and Zomato.

In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of $13.4 billion and $13.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2021, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations, and tax credits generated during the year, offset partially by the release of the valuation allowance due to deferred tax liabilities recorded as a result of the acquisitions providing an additional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.The indefinite carryforward period for net operating losses (\"NOLs\") means that indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities can be considered as support for realization of deferred tax assets, which can affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we realized approximately $744 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of our indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities being used as a source of income.As of December\u00a031, 2021, we had U.S.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 636538, "end_char_idx": 639009, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "408f615e-ddc7-41a3-8c81-cb6dac0b1a8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "408f615e-ddc7-41a3-8c81-cb6dac0b1a8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d70ce253-1f5a-44b7-92e8-d9326220423b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6b1e7e737017acf6b9c29de61707b23a8073d12ecbb85aa63fa3787b2c7ec82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "806d3698-3c01-46dd-9dd9-051d6920276f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "e4ce52840cc11f8a89310e819b19d324b8909f7dc752d4dfeb8d16af03b05a08", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3aed1781-6472-450d-a956-dbf42d2500d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3abe0f4c0bb716a8307b274befecbd1f3c6a35d6a7fc7185fafe507c74529c74", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of our indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities being used as a source of income.As of December\u00a031, 2021, we had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $3.2 billion that begin to expire in 2031 and $11.7 billion that have an unlimited carryover period.

The test is referred to as the \u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.On May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (\u201cLyft\u201d). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, and we filed a petition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November 2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5\u2019s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.Proposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result of the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors 127under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020.The California Supreme Court declined the petition for review on February 10, 2021.

The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization has also filed an appeal.

We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment law purposes.

While the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, we have recorded an accrual for these matters within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December\u00a031, 2021.128Other Driver Classification MattersAdditionally, we have received other lawsuits and governmental inquiries in other jurisdictions, and anticipate future claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, and government investigations and audits challenging our classification of Drivers as independent contractors and not employees. We believe that our current and historical approach to classification is supported by the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. However, the results of litigation and arbitration are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.State Unemployment TaxesIn 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor (\u201cNJDOL\u201d) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent contractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 660980, "end_char_idx": 663660, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9752454e-4bda-43ef-af73-a58d7201da3e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9752454e-4bda-43ef-af73-a58d7201da3e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d70ce253-1f5a-44b7-92e8-d9326220423b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6b1e7e737017acf6b9c29de61707b23a8073d12ecbb85aa63fa3787b2c7ec82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f1221222-943f-4cd5-8f77-3ea2c20b259a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "5855e4d0d275827d37c158bd8d31111f09201928efb74ceb0eb9183bee1ae4c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "885e4a49-1a7d-49f3-a3cd-5d56bfb2b43e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "54aa8a2f1c0694a501f4e6e611cf92b45eb4c7d63ce36d1c0eaedf1c64eab0e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019, against both Rasier and Uber.

Levandowski & Ron; Google v. LevandowskiOn October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach of their respective employment agreements with Google, fraud and other state law violations (due to soliciting Google employees and starting a new venture to compete with Google\u2019s business in contravention of their respective employment agreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution.

The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from our transactions with Drivers, as well as the tax treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes.

Being classified as a transportation provider would result in a VAT (20%) on Gross Bookings or on the service fee that we charge Drivers, both retroactively and prospectively. HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual Driver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, and HMRC is also expected to consider the U.K. Supreme Court\u2019s February 19, 2021 ruling on Drivers\u2019 worker classification, in determining whether we should be classified as a provider of transportation services.

We were exposed to Zomato\u2019s economic risks and rewards through our investment and note receivable which represent variable interests, and the carrying values of these variable interests reflect our maximum exposure to loss. However, we were not the primary beneficiary because neither the investment in CCPS Preferred Shares nor the note receivable provide us with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Zomato\u2019s economic performance.

The Initial Cornershop Investment was remeasured immediately prior to the acquisition of CS-Global, and based on the Cornershop business value and Uber\u2019s pre-acquisition ownership percentage, the new value was not materially different from the previously recognized amount. Thus, the Initial Cornershop Investment was determined at the original $50 million.

As consideration for the sale, Aurora issued Series U-1 preferred shares to the third party investors of the ATG Business to settle their ATG Series A Stated Liquidation Preference of $1.1 billion, which had previously been recorded as redeemable and non-redeemable non-controlling interests on our consolidated balance sheet prior to this transaction. We received the residual consideration from the sale as the only common unit holder of the ATG Business in the form of Aurora common shares valued at $1.3 billion, representing 22% of fully-diluted (25% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora. Concurrently, we invested $400 million in Aurora in exchange for Aurora Series U-2 convertible preferred shares, representing 4% of fully-diluted (5% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora.
