BUSINESSOverviewUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). We connect consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connect Riders and other consumers (\u201cEater(s)\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers (\u201cShipper(s)\u201d) with carriers (\u201cCarrier(s)\u201d) in the freight industry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to everyday problems.Our technology is available in approximately 70 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).Our SegmentsAs of December\u00a031, 2022, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 61336, "end_char_idx": 63777, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d368876-e0ec-47ad-9a5d-eb1c0e2fc27c": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d368876-e0ec-47ad-9a5d-eb1c0e2fc27c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8d96e152-8285-461c-a023-dc427e0efeff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "bc541f8ccb3dbdb9f74b31436d65b1ebd4d6540775dd08e858077020dd9af1e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "db46382b-420e-4b36-8a8a-95d5004b6e3d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "1bb948c21900aed1ccdaab0a9bdc6f8a68930d08ebdcedb70a2c2a506fab3a89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "88f1286a-f717-4afc-8dd0-7a2feb7d05fc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8c3b58c9eb539892cea0552e103026a361f6acc46edd269d93a18ec5072bbc81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.MobilityOur Mobility offering connects consumers with a wide range of transportation modalities, such as ridesharing, carsharing, micromobility, rentals, public transit, taxis, and more\u2014helping customers go almost anywhere they need. We believe our global leadership position\u2014and the vast amount of marketplace data that comes along with it\u2014means that we have the best technical and data platform to innovate faster than other companies with similar products. We believe our scale and global availability allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a variety of vehicle types, providing consumers with higher reliability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates.DeliveryOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover the best of local commerce\u2014from restaurants to grocery, alcohol, convenience and other retailers\u2014order a meal or other items, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered. We launched our Delivery app, Uber Eats, over seven years ago, and the business now includes the applications Postmates, Drizly and Cornershop across different markets. We believe our Delivery offering increases consumer engagement with the Uber platform overall, which in turn results in broader reach for our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without increasing their own costs. For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages, and has expanded our earner base by increasing utilization and earnings across the network. We also believe it also attracts new Drivers to the platform who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles. Over the last several years our Delivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-a-Service offering to retailers and restaurants around the world, as well as advertising opportunities.FreightWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight powers a managed transportation and logistics network and connects Shippers and Carriers in a digital marketplace to move shipments while leveraging our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries. Freight provides an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end while providing visibility and control of logistics networks.

By leveraging logistics solutions expertise and value-add solutions, Freight enables Shippers to create and tender shipments, secure capacity on demand with real-time pricing, and track those shipments from pickup to delivery. Freight operations are principally based in North America and Europe. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional transportation management and freight brokerage providers.4Platform SynergiesOur PlatformThe foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise. Together, these elements power movement from point A to point B.Massive NetworkOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers and Carriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip. In approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of December 31, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of a button for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people.Leading TechnologyWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of our deep technology advantage and include demand prediction, matching and dispatching, and pricing technologies. Our technologies make it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.Operational ExcellenceOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scale products in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and build and enhance relationships with cities and regulators.Product ExpertiseOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provide platform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety and trust.We intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.We believe that all of these synergies serve the customer experience, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen engagement with existing platform users.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 66207, "end_char_idx": 68973, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69f5b326-db12-490f-a61e-952983910a39": {"__data__": {"id_": "69f5b326-db12-490f-a61e-952983910a39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8d96e152-8285-461c-a023-dc427e0efeff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "bc541f8ccb3dbdb9f74b31436d65b1ebd4d6540775dd08e858077020dd9af1e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "88f1286a-f717-4afc-8dd0-7a2feb7d05fc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "932f8d0c8ce1e6f0a3f336f1c66e1447119af90ac0cfed523af85d93ed3be64f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1f1a2003-8e66-4950-a8a6-6300082b1db0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1f472872dcffffb3761ccc69bd24cb0cdf72b81bbaf6cf9c3a23a8526316402", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform-to-platform users. For example, Delivery attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December\u00a031, 2022, over 61% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our platform. Additionally, for the three months ended December\u00a031, 2022, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 10.9 Trips per month on average, compared to 4.6 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. We believe that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.With our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. In 2020, we rolled out our \u201cSuper App\u201d view on iOS and Android, which combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the United States as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priority service, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to remain available in select cities as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for our consumers. We exited 2022 with nearly 12 million members for our Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs. We are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlocking cross-platform advertising formats. During October 2022, we officially launched Uber\u2019s advertising division and introduced Uber Journey Ads, an engaging way for brands to connect with consumers throughout the entire ride process. We now offer a model that enables brands to partner with Uber on a variety of advertising options on the Uber and Uber Eats apps, and beyond, while connecting with consumers in brand-safe and captivating ways. We also provide comprehensive reporting and analysis, which helps brands fine-tune their understanding of consumers and create more impactful campaigns as they connect with consumers at relevant points throughout their journeys and transactions.

We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:5\u2022Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and Riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\u2022Delivery.

Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we are subject to are described below.MobilityOur platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model. Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (\u201cTNC\u201d) regulations.\u00a0These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 73548, "end_char_idx": 76274, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0221353d-1aab-4a01-b9d6-3be543e1370a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0221353d-1aab-4a01-b9d6-3be543e1370a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8d96e152-8285-461c-a023-dc427e0efeff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "bc541f8ccb3dbdb9f74b31436d65b1ebd4d6540775dd08e858077020dd9af1e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f2fb2f57-9893-4d3b-9f66-45b94c15c6a1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "6c4993070b7f64af3b17f4b46a4e52a3eb33b1150bc908352d20ce84e601aae2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "10cc5b78-edf9-4dbf-9513-56ae59feaa00", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "120c52ddcc9f6742580793c4d1a1712e06ebe3401e8c1e0c3594a44b46016715", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations.\u00a0These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.In addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, the parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and as a result of the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22.

Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.\u2022In addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap on the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New York City also established a standard for time and distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. As another example, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform.

The world of work has changed significantly in the last two years, and in response we have evolved our work philosophy to reflect all that we have learned and what we believe will produce the best results for our employees and our business going forward. Our work model has shifted to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home.Employee Engagement. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging and are able to achieve their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveys and related tools. We historically conducted a semi-annual workforce survey that measures employee engagement, overall satisfaction, and well-being. But in 2021, we made a shift toward continuous listening by collecting feedback from employees throughout the year and through various channels. We use the results of these regular checks to better understand employees\u2019 needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, and growth opportunities. For example, our hybrid return-to-office approach was shaped based on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operations 8through monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.Employee Development and Retention. We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged, satisfied, and productive. Employees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, participating in mentorship, or identifying their next opportunity within Uber through internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable them to have an impact on other areas of the business.

The information in the 2022 People and Culture report is not a part of this Form 10-K.Diversity and InclusionWe believe that great minds don\u2019t think alike, and we work hard to ensure that people of diverse backgrounds feel welcome and valued. We encourage different opinions and approaches to be heard, and then we come together and build. We believe that when employees feel empowered to succeed in a work environment that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows. To achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implement processes throughout Uber and measure progress. For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women, LGBTQIA+ individuals, people with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadership roles come from historically underrepresented groups.Our Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance metrics into the compensation packages of our most senior executives.We encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager, Uber\u2019s People Team or the Integrity Helpline.As a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically, or socially. To do that, we strive to help fight the racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and create opportunities for all, both inside and outside our company. In July 2020, we announced commitments to becoming a more anti-racist company and since then, we have made progress on our commitment to build racial equity internally and externally.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 90502, "end_char_idx": 92958, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3a548f7-1da8-4f19-958c-3dcf8ab58bbb": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3a548f7-1da8-4f19-958c-3dcf8ab58bbb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8d96e152-8285-461c-a023-dc427e0efeff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "bc541f8ccb3dbdb9f74b31436d65b1ebd4d6540775dd08e858077020dd9af1e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a27c135a-d899-42f4-93a3-0e339b2c1ee0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "0a3a67e69098f52c86924c4b5f59f8907d3cac8e1636adfc034b36f935b3ae42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "38b5f888-a843-496d-b67a-d8de5c9f8d98", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3fd19709e34c8199aecbb70f34b22f2cd64b4cc8242175bf7a92343f4e1c5153", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In July 2020, we announced commitments to becoming a more anti-racist company and since then, we have made progress on our commitment to build racial equity internally and externally.

The information in these reports is not a part of this Form 10-K.Driver and Courier Well-BeingIn addition to employees discussed above, our business also depends on our ability to attract and engage Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers, and Couriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations.In relation to those individuals who earn income on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world, providing accessible, flexible work in approximately 70 countries. Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created through its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with, traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.Accessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.\u2022Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 92775, "end_char_idx": 95451, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38b5f888-a843-496d-b67a-d8de5c9f8d98": {"__data__": {"id_": "38b5f888-a843-496d-b67a-d8de5c9f8d98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8d96e152-8285-461c-a023-dc427e0efeff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "bc541f8ccb3dbdb9f74b31436d65b1ebd4d6540775dd08e858077020dd9af1e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3a548f7-1da8-4f19-958c-3dcf8ab58bbb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "444778fcf185f87c9c1c279bb34af26cf9940eed111cc2f8ff56eebe3c436b55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "83066f7b-039b-436e-90bd-82b8792fca6e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3aaa1bb5a8ce1f4602fb9f4a58ac7625a6e97309a04d4b6e3cad70d1ecbbc570", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.\u2022Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the 9social safety net. This includes requiring Uber\u2014and other app based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some recent examples of our advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\u25e6In Washington State, we welcomed a new law that preserves rideshare driver independence and confers new benefits such as minimum earnings guarantee, injury protection and paid sick leave.\u25e6In Chile, the legislature passed a law that incorporates platform workers into the government\u2019s healthcare and pensions scheme and introduces new requirements for platform companies such as minimum earnings guarantee for time spent actively working, maintain on-app insurance coverage, and provide couriers with safety equipment.\u2022Protections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers. \u2022Earnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them save on costs and make informed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest). \u2022Learning and Growth: We have partnered with learning and academic institutions to provide opportunities to eligible Drivers and their family members through undergraduate degree programs and courses on entrepreneurship, skills development and language learning. For example, since its launch in 2018, our partnership with Arizona State University has enrolled nearly 5,000 Drivers and their family members in undergraduate degree programs online.\u2022Engagement: We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our platform. We believe that the best ideas can come from anywhere, both inside and outside our company. In locations around the world, we are piloting innovative ways for Drivers to participate in meaningful dialogue with us.

We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 105524, "end_char_idx": 108162, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13aea764-8064-4d2c-bbac-902ce3b62ec2": {"__data__": {"id_": "13aea764-8064-4d2c-bbac-902ce3b62ec2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8d96e152-8285-461c-a023-dc427e0efeff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "bc541f8ccb3dbdb9f74b31436d65b1ebd4d6540775dd08e858077020dd9af1e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bfeaf5d6-458a-43da-bb75-9ebe5d404691", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "c7a2e6192f09384a6ac2c8c11ae2a8897212870a617928856587a354c24dfb24", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "42f1f6b4-497b-422c-8de7-11733d3c07f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a12c868108012eb20d515b419d25b1de3c18656e4c850b7f898fcd9e1f93c262", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions. Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $521 million as of December\u00a031, 2022. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.Changes to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22.

For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, 12including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties.

Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.In addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations.

In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low.

In certain geographic markets and regions, we do not have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering such Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and will continue to negatively affect, our financial performance. Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have been modified over time and will likely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our pricing models or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Drivers. For example, changes we have made in California to the information that Drivers see in the application, as well as pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application.

To the extent a pandemic or other catastrophic event adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.The impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.Our performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. A deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, including slower growth or recession, inflation and higher interest rates, or decreases in consumer spending power may harm our results of operations. For example, inflation has increased and is expected to increase our insurance costs. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public transportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity and may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the merchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases from merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering.

For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical transportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that limit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are actively challenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business, especially our ridesharing services. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curb air pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including the institution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an \u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effect in April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transition to electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023.

The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance.

Other U.S. states have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil provides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.

If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies.

We are also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to everyday problems.Driver Classification DevelopmentsThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.47On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with the preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.In January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional, which was denied.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 333393, "end_char_idx": 336044, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39cd8aa3-bba2-4f82-bd8d-7d4f2b4dee91": {"__data__": {"id_": "39cd8aa3-bba2-4f82-bd8d-7d4f2b4dee91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8d96e152-8285-461c-a023-dc427e0efeff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "bc541f8ccb3dbdb9f74b31436d65b1ebd4d6540775dd08e858077020dd9af1e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0aad1176-2956-44d6-b3d4-ac6eaa98eb69", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "6ccca036c80105ad76e88b1ce9acece113d0580a36d0c80eb9d3bbc8bcecefb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "50002974-212e-492a-9773-b98ff66ddc47", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "136c5c1d43d9876b95c48846b303dab5ec56b05909b74f1310f21c866de26c26", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal. Oral argument was heard and we await a decision.To comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.Also of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) Employment Tribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling. Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK drivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bring their own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when driving with Uber.

In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management\u2019s internal comparisons to our historical performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. Accordingly, we believe that these\u00a0non-GAAP\u00a0financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

We have concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery transactions. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected.

Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer. Investments in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with the changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for investments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.Investments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requires judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level\u00a03 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available including observed transactions such as equity financing transactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees\u2019 securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar to the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.We assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equity securities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee\u2019s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors.

Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security\u2019s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method InvestmentsWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controlling financial interest, using the equity method.

Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.

Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different.

In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments.

We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.\u2022Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\u2022Expected volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of our own common shares within the same length of period as the expected term. Where, in some cases, our common share trading history is shorter than the expected term, we consider comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.\u2022Expected dividend yield. Expected dividend yield is zero percent, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.We continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected term utilized in our stock-based compensation expense calculation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expected term, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 416561, "end_char_idx": 419272, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56f4e209-df79-4965-98dd-21e27a51aa87": {"__data__": {"id_": "56f4e209-df79-4965-98dd-21e27a51aa87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8d96e152-8285-461c-a023-dc427e0efeff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "bc541f8ccb3dbdb9f74b31436d65b1ebd4d6540775dd08e858077020dd9af1e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d64af6fe-d83f-4d43-8a5f-1a100869036f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "ff31d6cb35b2c32805d8dfddd95fe38db3c301bcf92460caadddc26730451543", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d3c7b649-138d-4f38-9f24-0594128f16ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b9269053fa59aae8e64c9c1bb78861ae13dd6f0b1578cb5257a7adb48979149", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:Interest Rate RiskOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $232 million as of December\u00a031, 2022.Investment Risk Our investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $6.7 billion as of December\u00a031, 2021 and December\u00a031, 2022, respectively. Marketable debt securities classified as restricted investments and short-term investments totaled $1.7 billion as of December\u00a031, 2022. As of December\u00a031, 2022, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments.

Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.70Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 428265, "end_char_idx": 430700, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55324968-74a0-4730-a84f-b5366e317a8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "55324968-74a0-4730-a84f-b5366e317a8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8d96e152-8285-461c-a023-dc427e0efeff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "bc541f8ccb3dbdb9f74b31436d65b1ebd4d6540775dd08e858077020dd9af1e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6ae663fc-f809-47a7-aa16-fa3610736035", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "fb8f7763752efaa41fd78d595e5f3c7c7273f86a8502c518ec82662fa0e0801f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7f9292e5-c53c-4e0e-8fb3-abba152bfc4a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8823bd3e9b8fa966938563559829f8b9b498afbfe5176a1f6c5b6b45292263dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Presentation of Mobility and Delivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-UsersAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of the Company\u2019s platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged to end-users for use of the platform and in exchange for Mobility and Delivery services. Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. This determination impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis as well as the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company\u2019s Mobility and Delivery revenue, net of incentives, was $24.9 billion and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.2 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, including incentives, discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to whether transaction attributes were appropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed by management and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of BusinessUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies designed to  provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.Our technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).Basis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary.

Refer to Note 15 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of\u00a0goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting certain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments. The level of uncertainties and volatility related to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit RiskCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject to credit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high credit quality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of funds withheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims. We rely on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\u201cpayment service providers\u201d) to collect amounts due from end-users.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 452104, "end_char_idx": 454992, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3af088a-da5b-4603-aec2-9dafb9dc7c1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3af088a-da5b-4603-aec2-9dafb9dc7c1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8d96e152-8285-461c-a023-dc427e0efeff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "bc541f8ccb3dbdb9f74b31436d65b1ebd4d6540775dd08e858077020dd9af1e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "04156b58-6a03-4f34-82bf-62d3aa024a5f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "703dec3bee3f1d436cfc7f42f4bb9e728dbdffc6964a023b3af96065344926c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "693f6f6c-4976-4929-935e-c139107f0f89", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e23cf4357d7ae57584f4227aa4055dd6e8dee9d0cd5c3116b243b85f9bb5b1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Our other receivables primarily consist of funds withheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims.

Payment service providers are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality. No customers accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.Certain Significant Risks and UncertaintiesWe have incurred significant net losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of $32.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. Our operations have historically been funded through equity and debt financings. While management currently anticipates that our available cash and cash equivalents, and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, additional capital may need to be raised or additional indebtedness incurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, or our ability to incur additional indebtedness may be restricted by the terms of our existing debt instruments.81In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. COVID-19 has rapidly impacted market and economic conditions globally.

We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required.

Our marketable equity securities in publicly traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment.

Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are initially recorded at fair value. Investments in marketable debt securities may include U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and time deposits. Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities with redemption, interest, or other debt-like features were classified as available-for-sale debt securities. Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded in earnings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments. As of December\u00a031, 2022, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet.Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-sale Debt SecuritiesWe account for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (\u201cASC 326\u201d).

In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Restricted InvestmentsAs of December\u00a031, 2022, restricted investments on the consolidated balance sheet are comprised of marketable debt securities that may include U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and time deposits, which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions pursuant to certain contracts with insurance providers.

We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying amount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows it expects the asset group to generate.

These evaluations are complex, involve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that an entity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated financial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.

We derive our revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of our platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services, including facilitating payments from end-users. The service enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the \u201cUber Service\u201d). Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we also generate revenue from end-users. We charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Mobility and Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue from customers' use of Freight services. We periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.Mobility and Delivery AgreementsWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines the service fee we charge Drivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user. The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between us and the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 ability to cancel the transaction lapses.The Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.In 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for Delivery services to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contracts shall be recognized separately for each under ASC 606.

In these markets, we are the principal for the services and present the respective Mobility and Delivery revenue on a gross basis because we are primarily responsible for the services.Mobility We derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Riders and successfully complete a trip via the Platform. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. Depending on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing services provided. Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically receive the service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a trip.In addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips. On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers. We generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Drivers incentives, or via online payment methods. As we currently have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips and cannot control whether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, we concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until collected from Drivers.Mobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products.87DeliveryWe derive our Delivery revenue primarily from service fees paid by Couriers and Merchants for use of the platform and related service to successfully complete a meal delivery service on the platform.

We recognize revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents our performance over the period of time a shipment is in transit. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end are not material. Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon receipt of invoice.Transportation ManagementWe provide an integrated logistics and transportation service, which can include shipment planning, freight optimization, carrier assignment, load management, freight audit and payment processing and other related transportation services.

Incentives to customers that are not provided in exchange for a distinct good or service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Since incentives are earned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.Incentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. We expense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 and expense costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is established using amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 were immaterial.In some transactions, incentives and payments made to customers may exceed the revenue earned in the transaction.

Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We elected the tax law ordering approach in assessing the realizability of net operating losses expected to offset future Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d).We have elected to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost.The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 507360, "end_char_idx": 510165, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c3aa013-0941-45e7-8e83-3c35a3f26514": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c3aa013-0941-45e7-8e83-3c35a3f26514", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8d96e152-8285-461c-a023-dc427e0efeff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "bc541f8ccb3dbdb9f74b31436d65b1ebd4d6540775dd08e858077020dd9af1e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "de372a43-4c34-43a6-b32c-45b4570f5331", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "32accd9ed5b7571e7fe5a8f2b699edc035f83186cf01a479fba761f2dd353b2f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cfb254d3-b8d2-4a30-9181-03535e92aaa3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e411b047bae8c6e42bf2455485318ff3221b72df402b40bb005ccb1cbb492138", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates.

Our restricted common stock, and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. We consider restricted common stock and any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock.Insurance ReservesWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers\u2019 compensation.

All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process.

Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.

Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security.

Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.Once the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the investees\u2019 expected time to liquidity and volatility.96An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities on a specific identification method.

As of December 31, 2022, the exercise price of the MLU B.V. Call Option is approximately $1.9 billion, subject to certain adjustments based on the timing of the option exercise. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option was $193 million, including the recognition of an immaterial gain for the fair value change during the year ended December 31, 2021. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were underlying business value, option term of 1.7 years, volatility of 50%, risk-free interest rates, and strike price (Level 3).As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option was $2 million. We recorded a $191 million net gain for the fair value change during the year ended December 31, 2022. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V.

We contributed $136 million cash in exchange for a 45% interest in ECOP. The two LLC Partners own 45% and 10%, respectively. The equity ownership interest in ECOP remained at 45% as of December 31, 2021 and 2022.In March 2020, the two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries took out new loans. Upon closing of the new financing, the proceeds were used to first pay off the existing construction loan, then to cover the required operation reserve as well as various financing costs, and last, the remaining proceeds were distributed back to Uber and the LLC Partners based on their ownership percentage. As a result, Uber received $91 million from the ECOP as a return of capital investment, and reduced the investment carrying value by the same amount. We have significant influence over ECOP and we account for our investment in ECOP under the equity method. At each reporting period and a quarter in arrears, we adjust the carrying value of our investment to reflect our proportionate share of ECOP\u2019s income or loss, and any impairments, with a corresponding credit or debit, respectively, to income or loss from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations. During 2019, the construction was completed and leasing activities commenced, During 2020, 2021 and 2022 an immaterial amounts of equity earnings were recognized.

To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as of the pricing date, we used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.Effective January\u00a01, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the opening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January\u00a01, 2021 interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 Convertible Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.The fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $973 million as of December\u00a031, 2022 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.Senior NotesIn October 2018, we issued five-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $500 million due on November\u00a01, 2023 (the \u201c2023 Senior Notes\u201d) and eight-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on November\u00a01, 2026 (the \u201c2026 Senior Notes\u201d) in a private placement offering totaling $2.0 billion.

In connection with the enactment of California State Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number of misclassification claims.

The test is referred to as the \u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.On May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (\u201cLyft\u201d). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, and we filed a petition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November 2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5\u2019s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.Proposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result of the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020.121The California Supreme Court declined the petition for review on February 10, 2021.

We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals.In April 2021, a ruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Rasier Operations B.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2021. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 as dependent workers of Uber B.V. and Rasier Operations B.V. from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and has no impact on our current operations. On June 3, 2022, the Federal Tribunal issued two rulings by which both Drivers and Couriers in the Canton of Geneva are classified as employees of Uber BV, Uber Portier B.V. and Uber Switzerland GmbH.Following this ruling, we received a request for information from the SVA Z\u00fcrich that states that couriers shall be considered employees for social security purposes since the launch of Uber Eats.

The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment of the App in July 2016.

We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment law purposes. Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing. On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when driving with Uber.

The department issued an assessment in 2016 for the periods of 2013 - 2015 and we have since reached an agreement with the CA EDD for this period. In 2022, we have received requests for information related to an audit of a subsequent period, which covers the fourth quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2020. We have also received an audit for years 2018 - 2020 covering couriers who used the Postmates platform.

The NYDOL issued an assessment in November 2022, against Uber. The ultimate resolution of the matter is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December\u00a031, 2022.Non-Income Tax MattersWe recorded an estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regard to such matters. 123The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arise from the characterization for tax purposes of the transactions on the platform, as well as the tax treatment of certain employee benefits and employment taxes related to our Drivers and Couriers.

As a result of the settlement agreement, these prior periods are closed to assessment and Uber made a payment of $733 million (GBP 613 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022 for this resolution. As of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, such that as of that date Uber UK is a merchant of transportation and is required to remit VAT. Uber UK is remitting VAT under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987 (\u201cVAT Order 1987\u201d), which allows for VAT remittance on a calculated margin, rather than on Gross Bookings. As part of our ongoing discussions with HMRC, they have indicated that they are reviewing our VAT filings.

Pursuant to these provisions, we may be obligated to indemnify such parties for losses or claims suffered or incurred in connection with their activities or non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by us. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain current and former employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain indemnification obligations.

However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in \u201cInternal Control - Integrated Framework\u201d (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Based on that assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\u00a031, 2022.
